Promoting Theory-Based Perspectives in Sexual Double Standard Research	SEX ROLES			English	Review						Sexual double standard; Evolutionary theory; Social role theory; Cognitive social learning theory; Sex differences; Sexual behavior; Gender roles	GENDER-DIFFERENCES; MARRIAGE DESIRABILITY; DATING RELATIONSHIPS; JAPANESE STUDENTS; COLLEGE-STUDENTS; PERCEPTIONS; JUDGMENTS; WOMEN; MEN; PERMISSIVENESS	The sexual double standard (SDS) has been a focus of research for several decades. Numerous anecdotal accounts of the double standard exist, detailing its consequences and impact on women's, as well as men's, sexual behavior and identities. Empirical research, however, has yet to completely corroborate the degree to which the double standard pervades everyday life. The disparity between anecdotal accounts and empirical evidence related to the SDS may be the result of the partially atheoretical approach with which the SDS has traditionally been examined. The goal of the present paper is to encourage researchers to take a more theory-oriented approach to understanding the double standard. Our goal is not to provide another comprehensive literature review or an argument for the "best" theory, but rather to promote theory-based perspectives in future SDS research. In the current paper, three theoretical perspectives-evolutionary theory, social role theory, and cognitive social learning theory-and their relevance to the SDS are discussed. We discuss four hypotheses, one related to the core tenet of the SDS itself, and three related to moderating factors, including characteristics of evaluators (i.e., gender, gender roles beliefs, and sexual history), characteristics of targets (i.e., relationship type engaged in, sexual activities participated in, and power status), and social factors (i.e., cultural background, historical era, and socialization agents). Existing research is also interpreted in light of one or more of the theoretical perspectives in the hopes of guiding future research.

Despite this similarity, video gaming is still strongly associated with men. A common justification for this stereotype is that, although women might play games, they should not be considered "true" or "hard-core" gamers because they play more casually and less skillfully compared to their male counterparts. In this contribution, we review the existing literature on gender and gaming to investigate the male gamer stereotype in terms of its accuracy, persistence, effects, and future perspective. We conclude that the stereotype varies in accuracy depending on the definition of "gamer." We further argue that the persistence of this stereotype can be explained by the fact that almost all professional and highly visible figures in gaming culture are male. On the other hand, female players who achieve a moderate level of competence are rendered invisible or are actively marginalized. We argue that the effects of the male gamer stereotype can be harmful to women, precluding them from the positive outcomes of video game play such as enhanced access to fields of science, technology, and engineering.

A survey of 555 university students in Singapore showed that young people of both sexes generally held positive attitudes toward cosmetic surgery. We observed no significant gender disparities in their acceptance of cosmetic surgery or intention to undergo cosmetic surgery. We tested the influence of the presumed media influence model, and our findings supported direct and indirect models of media influence on young people's attitudes toward cosmetic surgery. The indirect model was mediated by perceived influence of cosmetic surgery-related media on peers. We also found that men were more susceptible to the influence of presumed media influence than women were. Practice implications of our study for educators include open discussions regarding cosmetic surgery and the influence of media and peers among young people, as well as differentiating intervention programs for emerging adult women and men.

Specifically, we proposed that materialism would increase women's tendency to regard sexual attractiveness as capital for them to gain positive life outcomes (i.e., capitalization of sexual attractiveness, CSA), and the tendency to have appearance-contingent self-worth (i.e., appearance CSW), which would in turn predict their self-objectification and body surveillance. Results provided support for the proposed theoretical model. Specifically, CSA and appearance CSW mediated the relationship between materialism and women's self-objectification, whereas appearance CSW mediated the relationship between materialism and women's body surveillance. These results expand the scope of investigation by incorporating Chinese samples and suggest that in addition to socio-cultural and interpersonal predictors, women's values can contribute to the development of an objectifying perspective on themselves. Therefore, interventions on women's values combined with attempts to change sexually-objectifying environments are both critical in reducing self-objectification and body surveillance in women.

J	Forsman, JA; Barth, JM				Forsman, J. Andrew; Barth, Joan M.			The Effect of Occupational Gender Stereotypes on Men's Interest in Female-Dominated Occupations	SEX ROLES			English	Article						Occupation stereotypes; Career interest; Social roles; Precluded interest theory; Masculinity; Gender differences	VOCATIONAL INTERESTS; CAREER CHOICE; WOMEN; CIRCUMSCRIPTION; TRADITIONALITY; ASPIRATIONS; MASCULINITY; AFFORDANCES; VALUES; MODEL	A great deal of research has sought to explain women's lower interest in male-dominated occupations, but relatively little attention has been given to explaining men's disinterest in female-dominated occupations. Examining factors that affect men's interest in female-dominated occupations has both theoretical and practical implications. Two factors hypothesized to alter the gender-stereotype salience of an occupation were examined: occupation titles and gender-stereotyped occupation descriptions. We hypothesized that men who reported higher levels of stereotypical feminine attributes would be more interested in feminine-stereotyped occupations. College-aged participants (N = 1001, 791 male) enrolled in an engineering, computer science, or physics course recorded their interest in occupations with or without a feminine title and described with either feminine or masculine stereotyped skills and attributes. Participants also reported the degree to which they held stereotypical feminine attributes. Results indicated that men showed greater interest in no-title occupations, especially when masculine characteristics were used in the description. For men, self-reported levels of feminine attributes were associated with interest in occupations with feminine descriptions, primarily in the no-title condition. Women expressed more interested than did men in the occupations, but unlike men, women were equally interested in occupations with feminine and masculine descriptions. Findings are consistent with the theories of precluded interest (Cheryan 2010) and circumscription and compromise (Gottfredson 1981). It is concluded that a key for attracting men to female-dominated vocations may be to provide opportunities for men to consider an occupation in ways that prevent or disrupt comparison to traditional stereotypic archetypes.

However, no known previous research has investigated whether intergroup contact can also reduce sexism against women. Sexism has an array of negative outcomes. One of the most detrimental and violent ones is rape, which is both justified and downplayed by rape myth acceptance. We hypothesised that more frequent, higher quality contact with counter-stereotypical women would predict lower levels of sexism and thus less rape myth acceptance (in men) and less sexualised projected responses to rape (in women). Two studies using online surveys with community samples supported these hypotheses. In Study 1, 170 male participants who experienced more positive contact with counter-stereotypical women reported less intention to rape. Similarly, in Study 2, 280 female participants who experienced more positive contact with counter-stereotypical women reported less projected sexual arousal at the thought of being raped. Thus, the present research is the first known to show that contact could be a potential tool to combat sexism, rape myth acceptance, intentions to rape in men, and sexualisation of rape by women.

Why do women hold inferior positions in the military? How are sexism and Turkish identification relevant to attitudes toward the masculine structure of the military? Focusing on these questions, the current study explored the associations among Turkish identification, ambivalent sexism (including hostile and benevolent sexism), and attitudes toward the masculine structure of the military in Turkey after controlling for gender, political views, and military affiliation. University students (316 women; 262 men; M (age) = 22.02, SD = 2.20) completed the Attitude toward The Masculine Structure of the Military, Turkish Identification, Ambivalent Sexism scales and provided information about age, gender, political view, and military affiliation. The results showed that Turkish identification, hostile sexism, and benevolent sexism predicted attitudes toward the masculine structure of the military after controlling for gender, political view, and military affiliation. Participants who scored higher on Turkish identification and hostile and benevolent sexism supported the masculine structure of the military. The findings may be useful for researchers who aim to better understand why Turkish military personnel is primarily male, how some improvement can be provided for the process of recruitment and retention of military personnel, and how to improve the positions of women in the military or women who would like to join military.

Freedom of Information (FOI) requests are a data collection tool that allow citizens to obtain data held by public authorities in the UK and are particularly useful for uncovering information on marginalised groups who may be difficult to recruit in qualitative research. Whilst they are frequently used by journalists, their potential is yet to be fully realised by social researchers. This paper reflects on the use of Freedom of Information requests in a mixed-method feminist study exploring sexual violence against people aged 60 years and over.

Focussing on an often hidden yet significant part of our methodological decisions and recruitment, this paper details the online abuse levelled by men's rights activists against a research project on women's experiences of men's stranger intrusions in public space. It argues for the need to locate such experiences within a violence-against-women frame, extending the concept of a continuum of sexual violence. Such an extension renders visible the added labour of 'safety work', which forms an invisible backdrop to the methodological decisions of many feminist researchers.

Drawing on feminist standpoint theory, 'reflexive email interviewing' is proposed as a method for feminist research. The method is illustrated using a recent case study of email interviews with self-identified women who are members of World Pulse, an online community that aims to unite and amplify women's voices worldwide. Through this case study, issues of power and resistance in the researcher/researched relationship and of participant reflexivity are interrogated. Lastly, criteria for reflexive email interviewing are proposed, including 1) strategies to interrogate and disrupt power hierarchies within the research process, 2) researcher reflexivity as a continuous part of the research process, and 3) continued invitations for participants to directly reflect on and respond to the research process. Reflexive questions are offered for researchers to use during research design and in each phase of their research process to ensure reflexivity is achieved.

J	Pester, H				Pester, Holly			archive fanfiction: experimental archive research methodologies and feminist epistemological tactics	FEMINIST REVIEW			English	Article						archive research; epistemology; fan fiction; gossip; practice-based; fabulation		This essay proposes that subcultural practices such as gossip and fan writing are feminist epistemologies that can form radical archive inquiry and knowledge production, and creative outputs. Drawing on feminist new materialism and archive theory, I develop a set of principles for practice-based research methodologies that incorporate a researcher's intersubjective relationship with archive matter (e.g. records, documents, classification systems, social-material contexts) and consider the production of knowledge from such research as forms of fabulation. Fabulation here is seen as part of a critically transgressive epistemological stance that expands feminist critiques of universalising master narratives and archive orthodoxies. My proposition, formed in part through a residency in the Woman's Art Library in London, is to name such research gestures 'archive fanfiction', where experimental and practice-oriented method moves with feminist politics and activism.

Associations Between Sexual Behavior Norm Beliefs in Relationships and Intimate Partner Rape Judgments	VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN			English	Article						intimate partner rape; social norms; gender differences; sexual behavior	MARITAL RAPE; DATE RAPE; ASSAULT; WOMEN; EXPERIENCES; PERCEPTIONS; GENDER; ATTRIBUTIONS; ATTITUDES; VIOLENCE	Using a community sample (n = 296), we investigated the associations between sexual behavior norm beliefs, acceptance of partner rape, judgments that non-consensual partner sex is "wrong not rape," and decisions if non-consensual partner sex should be charged as rape. Sexual behavior norm beliefs were associated both directly and indirectly with latter components in the model related to acceptance of non-consensual partner sex judgments and charging rape judgments. In addition, participant gender moderated the model, such that many of the associations between the variables were stronger for males than for females. The results have implications for understanding how individuals label rape between intimate partners.

Consequently, this study aims to identify factors related to forgiveness of intimate partner violence (IPV). It was hypothesized that commitment would predict forgiveness and that minimization of aggression would mediate this relation, as women may be more likely to minimize the severity of the IPV to reduce the dissonance that arises from being committed to unhealthy relationships. Results generally supported hypotheses and findings; limitations and future directions are discussed.

Some 22% of women in Cross River and 9% in Bauchi reported IPV in their last pregnancy. The risk was higher in communities where more women reported IPV in the past year and lower among less poor women with more educated partners. Women were more likely to experience IPV in pregnancy if they had an income and decided how to spend it. Efforts to reduce IPV in pregnancy should involve communities as well as individuals.

J	Fahs, B; Swank, E				Fahs, Breanne; Swank, Eric			Exploring stigma of "extreme" weight gain: The terror of fat possible selves in women's responses to hypothetically gaining one hundred pounds	WOMENS STUDIES INTERNATIONAL FORUM			English	Article						Fatness Gender norms; Women's bodies; Body image; Weight gain; Fat phobia; Emotions	ADOLESCENTS POSSIBLE SELVES; BODY-IMAGE; COLLEGE-WOMEN; PHYSICAL-ACTIVITY; ANOREXIA-NERVOSA; AFRICAN-AMERICAN; FEMINIST ISSUE; OBESITY; PREGNANCY; IDENTITY	As insidious fat-phobia, fat talk, and fat-negative attitudes and behaviors permeate women's narratives about their bodies, fear of fatness and disdain for fat bodies has become a normative part of women's lives. That said, little is known about how women imagine their future selves and future weight gain, or how they would react to hypothetically imagining major weight gain despite the fact that over a third of American women are labeled as "obese" and many of them have gained at least 100 lb. This study analyzed semi-structured interviews with twenty women from a diverse 2014 community sample (mean age: 35.35, SD: 12.01) collected in a large Southwestern U.S. city in order to examine U.S. women's subjective feelings about hypothetically gaining significant weight. Results, centered on five themes, connected hypothetical weight gain to severe fat negativity: 1) Weight blame: Anger and disgust directed toward self; 2) Familiarity of gaining weight; 3) Fear of physical limitations; 4) Loss of "sexiness" and loss of male gaze; and 5) Severely distressed feeling that life is over. Tensions about the meaning of fatness and its physical and emotional implications for women were explored, alongside an analysis of how the hypothetically fat body produced visceral reactions, concerns about health, beliefs that attractiveness and eroticism were in danger, and, for some women, severely phobic reactions about fat bodies. Tensions between weight gain that are seen as "extreme" and mundane are also discussed. Methodological implications for how hypothetical questions can elicit strong emotional content are also discussed. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Dollar, CB				Dollar, Cindy Brooks			Does the use of binary indicators reify difference and inequality?	WOMENS STUDIES INTERNATIONAL FORUM			English	Review						Gender inequality; Sexed bodies; Heteronormativity; Degendering	UNDOING GENDER; IDENTITY; ACCOUNTABILITY; CATEGORIES; SEXUALITY; ENOUGH; SEX	Scholarship has noted the omnipresence of gender and has revealed persistent devaluation of women and their bodies. Illuminating the limitations of our existing gender order, feminist scholars have focused on the problem of gender duality. In doing so, questions about the validity of binary gender and sex categories have been raised. Calls to "undo gender", however, are met with an acknowledgement of institutionalized accountability structures, which perpetuate gendering and reinforce sex and gender as containing discrete, dichotomous categories. While recognizing the socio-political necessity to eliminate this dualistic understanding of gender, I argue using binary indicators remains an important part of the feminist research agenda. I acknowledge the tension between these two positions but suggest that the continued use of existing binaries does not preclude calls for a degendering movement. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Ranani, SRA; Kharazmi, ZN				Ranani, Saied Reza Ameli; Kharazmi, Zohreh Nosrat			The significance of Muslim women in American foreign policy case study: Hillary Clinton's prophecy for women of science in MENA	WOMENS STUDIES INTERNATIONAL FORUM			English	Article						Gender regime; MENA; American diplomacy; Academia; TechWomen; NeXXt Scholars Initiative		"Gender regime change" is regarded as an inevitable global process. Today, the "status of women" unprecedentedly becomes the "barometer" of societies and the measure of the advancement of civilizations. The contemporary international gender regime is based on a system of so-called modern values and, as the historical records indicate, the United States has been prominent in defining the global "status of women", its norms and mechanisms. The present study takes Hillary Clinton's tenure at the Department of State (2009-2013) as a synopsis of American history during which the status of women became a "cornerstone" of American foreign policy. It delves into the concept of the "Hillary Effect" as a definitive factor in the US' engagement policy with Muslim women in the Middle East and North Africa. Its argument is that the US employs academic exchanges and university-oriented programs to mobilize new generations of Muslim women scholars as the sources of "change" and "democratization" in the region. Two major projects including TechWomen and NeXXt Scholars Initiative are examined as the case studies to give an overview of the US' major educational strategies overseas. The results indicate the mentioned strategies to include: a) inspiring women for future leadership and democratization, b) prioritizing the English language as the medium to communicate, c) setting programs based on bilateral willingness, d) inspiring a sense of empowerment, expanding membership in, and finally nurturing the sense of belonging to American culture and political thought.

J	Donaghy, RJ				Donaghy, Ryan J.			Pedagogies of neopatriarchy: Critical reflections on occupational courses and women's economic mobility in Turkey	WOMENS STUDIES INTERNATIONAL FORUM			English	Article						Gender; Adult education; Economic mobility; Turkey		The purpose of this article is to explore women's critical reflections on occupational courses and women's economic mobility in Turkey. Using qualitative data from twenty-four semi-structured interviews with education program coordinators located in women's organizations, I explore the limitations of increasing women's economic mobility vis-a-vis state-sponsored occupational courses by focusing on participants' reflections on the challenges of coordinating adult education programs. I argue that their experiences not only demonstrate the constraints surrounding non-formal educational initiatives, but also indicate that state-sponsored occupational and job-skills courses serve to further the political strategy of a neopatriarchal state in two distinct ways: 1) the potential effectiveness of these courses has largely been constrained by the exclusion of women from decision -making mechanisms; and 2) courses reinforce women's secondary status in the formal labor market.

J	Newton, VL				Newton, Victoria Louise			'It's good to be able to talk': An exploration of the complexities of participant and researcher relationships when conducting sensitive research	WOMENS STUDIES INTERNATIONAL FORUM			English	Article								Drawing on qualitative data from a project on young women's experiences of abortion, this paper considers the dual exchange of the research interview. It considers the view that researcher and participant 'collude' in the research process to meet their individual and differing needs. The paper explores the researcher's active role in stimulating participants to talk about and disclose highly personal, and potentially stigmatising, experiences and interrogates the ways in which participants may use, or re-frame, research in a quasi-therapeutic capacity as a process of catharsis. This raises questions around whether the participant and researcher share common research goals, and the implications of this for informed consent. The paper concludes with discussion of the problems of balancing the need of the researcher to 'get the job done' and to generate meaningful rich data, and the need to prioritise participant and researcher wellbeing throughout the research, suggesting that further consideration needs to be given to the post-consent process.

J	Hoggart, L				Hoggart, Lesley			Collaboration or collusion? Involving research users in applied social research	WOMENS STUDIES INTERNATIONAL FORUM			English	Article								This paper focuses on the difficulties of pursuing a research agenda firmly based on women's reproductive rights, whilst working in the context of a sexual health policy framework that has different priorities. Drawing on the experiences of two applied social research projects in the area of sexual health, the paper considers the tensions and challenges associated with maintaining a feminist conceptual framework, and simultaneously striving to undertake research that would have an impact on policy and practice. The first project studied young women, abortion and 'repeat' abortion: the word 'repeat' carries with it notions of a repeat offender, and has been identified as contributing towards abortion stigma. The second project examined why young women may have their contraceptive implant removed 'early': acceptance of this word implied collusion with dominant policy conceptions based on a cost effective approach to contraceptive provision. The researchers had some.misgivings about the policy framing, and sought to locate the research within an overarching objective of seeking to understand how women's reproductive control might be improved; a very basic feminist outcome that might be shared (at an abstract level) with policy-makers. Research is, however, a messy complex undertaking: in practice, multiple understandings of similar findings are possible and researchers negotiate their final outputs to suit particular audiences. Both projects involved contradictions, uncertainties and potential for collusions which are explored in the paper. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Rogers, C				Rogers, Chrissie			"I'm complicit and I'm ambivalent and that's crazy": Care-less spaces for women in the academy	WOMENS STUDIES INTERNATIONAL FORUM			English	Article							HIGHER-EDUCATION; FEMINIST; UNIVERSITY; GENDER; LABOR	This paper is about three working class women academics in their 40s, who are at different phases in their career. I take a reflexive, feminist, (Reay 2000, 2004, Ribbens and Edwards, 1998) life story approach (Plummer, 2001) in order to understand their particular narratives about identity, complicity, relationships and discomfort within the academy, and then how they inhabit care-less spaces. However unique their narratives, I am able to explore an aspect of higher education - women and their working relationships - through a lens of care-less spaces, and argue that care-less-ness in the academy, can create and reproduce animosity and collusion. Notably, this is damaging for intellectual pursuits, knowledge production and markedly, the identity of woman academics. In introducing this work, I first contextualise women in the academy and define the term care-less spaces, then move onto discuss feminist methods. I then explore and critique in some detail, the substantive findings under the headings of 'complicity and faking it' and 'publishing and collaboration'. The final section concludes the paper by drawing on Herring's (2013) legal premise, in the context of care ethics, as a way to interrogate particular care-less spaces within higher education.

J	Wright, HR; Cooper, L; Luff, P				Wright, Hazel R.; Cooper, Linda; Luff, Paulette			Women's ways of working: Circumventing the masculine structures operating within and upon the University	WOMENS STUDIES INTERNATIONAL FORUM			English	Article						Higher education; University; Gender; Feminist research; Caring; Reflective practice	HIGHER-EDUCATION; ACADEMIC CAREERS; GENDER; MASSIFICATION; PRODUCTIVITY; CULTURE	Three female, and feminist, academics become participant researchers to explore their working practices seeking to make visible the ways they work to wo(manage) the masculinist environment of the University. After reviewing the literature, the paper starts by considering what 'masculinist' means in this context, finding that it refers to both rigidity of structure positioned as 'impartial' and, paradoxically, processes that enable competition and the clear identification of winners and losers; a University regime compatible with neo-liberal governance. Such values are at odds with those promoted within Early Years Education where 'caring' and 'inclusion' are fundamental, embedded in a strong 'domestic' tradition. The paper examines the historical practice of transferring 'mothering' skills into the educational institution and considers current attitudes and behaviours in relation to this synergy. Analysing their own attitudes and practices through an innovative (and time-effective) methodology, AAA/I (Asynchronous Associative Auto/Inquiry), the participant researchers consider the ways in which, through collaboration, they ameliorate University processes and working conditions to support each other and their students. Findings are discussed in relation to masculinist traditions and competitiveness, collaboration and caring, and the creation of 'protective enclaves', feminised micro-contexts within the larger masculinist domain. Considering their actions in toto, the trio reflect on the extent that their actions promote, evade or hinder a move towards greater gender equality and admit to the personal costs of continually striving to change the working environment.

Produced through Project Re center dot Vision, these micro documentaries uncover the cultures and temporalities of bodies of difference by foregrounding themes of multiple histories: body, disability, maternal, medical, and/or scientific histories; and divergent futurities: contradictory, surprising, unpredictable, opaque, and/or generative futures. We engage with Alison Kafer's call to theorize disability futurity by wrestling with the ways in which the future is normatively deployed in the service of able-bodiedness and able-mindedness (Kafer ), a deployment used to render bodies of difference as sites of no future (Edelman ). By re-storying embodied difference, the storytellers illuminate ongoing processes of remaking their bodily selves in ways that respond to the past and provide possibilities for different futures; these orientations may be configured as dis-topias based not on progress, but on new pathways for living, uncovered not through evoking the familiar imaginaries of curing, eliminating, or overcoming disability, but through incorporating experiences of embodied difference into time. These temporalities gesture toward new kinds of futures, giving us glimpses of ways of cripping time, of cripping ways of being/becoming in time, and of radically re-presencing disability in futurity.

J	Gallegos, S; Quinn, C				Gallegos, Sergio; Quinn, Carol			Epistemic Injustice and Resistance in the Chiapas Highlands: The Zapatista Case	HYPATIA-A JOURNAL OF FEMINIST PHILOSOPHY			English	Article							MEXICO	Though Indigenous women in Mexico have traditionally exhibited some of the highest levels of maternal mortality in the countrya fact that some authors have argued was an important reason to explain the EZLN uprising in 1994there is some evidence that the rate of maternal mortality has fallen in Zapatista communities in the Chiapas Highlands in the last two decades, and that other health indicators have improved. In this article, we offer an account of the modest success that Zapatista communities have achieved in improving their health levels. In particular, we argue that Zapatista women have implicitly used a form of feminist standpoint theory to diagnose the epistemic (and economic) injustice to which they have been traditionally subjected and to develop an epistemology of resistance that is manifested in actions such as becoming health promoters in their communities. We also argue that this epistemology of resistance is partially responsible for the improvement of health levels in their communities. Finally, on the basis of our discussion of the Zapatista case, we suggest that standpoint theory could play an important role in other healthcare settings involving oppressed minorities.

J	Neumann, CB				Neumann, Cecilie Basberg			A Dangerous Subject: The Fashion Model and the Beauty/Narcissism Double Bind	HYPATIA-A JOURNAL OF FEMINIST PHILOSOPHY			English	Article								In the wake of modernity, women's sexuality was positioned in a way that created a beauty/narcissism double bind that is still with us today. My concern in this article is that the subject position of fashion model serves as a constant reminder of this split, which is directed at all women and weakens the generalized woman's political agency. Fashion models themselves experience harassment and humiliation as well as pleasure and desire in their work as fashion models. However, the small portion of feminist work that has engaged explicitly with the fashion-model business sees it mainly as an enterprise that is alienating and hostile to women. Although I do not entirely disagree with this analysis, it neglects the meaning of beauty and what beauty does to us with regard to creativity and pleasure. I wish to explore how some of the work experience of fashion models intersects with and challenges the beauty/narcissism double bind. I suggest that rather than grounding our understanding of thesubject position fashion model and the fashion business solely in their reinforcement of the beauty/narcissism double bind, we should pay attention to the importance of what beauty and aspects of narcissism may mean.

J	Davies, SE; True, J				Davies, Sara E.; True, Jacqui			The politics of counting and reporting conflict-related sexual and gender-based violence: the case of Myanmar	INTERNATIONAL FEMINIST JOURNAL OF POLITICS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	4th Annual International Feminist Journal of Politics (IFJP) Conference	JUN 18-19, 2015	Univ Queensland, Brisbane, AUSTRALIA		Univ Queensland	Conflict-related sexual and gender-based violence; ethnic conflict; human rights reporting; feminist methodology; Myanmar	ARMED CONFLICT; WOMEN; RIGHTS; COUNTRIES; WAR	Scholars, states and international organizations have begun to systematically count, document and compare sexual and gender-based violence (SGBV) in conflict-affected countries. Qualitative and quantitative studies point to a tip of the iceberg phenomenon, where there is a high prevalence but low level of actual reporting of SGBV. We investigate the conditions in which SGBV is reported or, more significantly, is not reported to discover the trends of reporting in politically oppressive environments where SGBV is thought to be occurring. We ask how the power to report in local conflict-affected areas is affected by national political tensions and pervasive gender discrimination. Reporting of SGBV in Myanmar, a country that has experienced multiple, protracted conflicts since independence, is examined. Analysis of open-access reports over a fifteen-year period reveals a pattern of silence that we argue is rooted in pervasive discriminatory civil and physical practices against women. Engaging with the deeply politicized and gender discriminatory context of conflict-affected societies enables us to see the anomalies of SGBV data and to highlight significant gaps in our knowledge about SGBV.

J	Tanyag, M				Tanyag, Maria			Invisible labor, invisible bodies: how the global political economy affects reproductive freedom in the Philippines	INTERNATIONAL FEMINIST JOURNAL OF POLITICS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	4th Annual International Feminist Journal of Politics (IFJP) Conference	JUN 18-19, 2015	Univ Queensland, Brisbane, AUSTRALIA		Univ Queensland	Depletion; reproductive freedom; social reproduction; religious fundamentalisms; feminist political economy	SOCIAL REPRODUCTION; GENDER; WORKERS; RIGHTS; WOMEN; MIGRATION; EQUALITY; VIOLENCE; CRISIS; STATE	Feminist scholars have critically demonstrated the links between the global political economy, social reproduction and gender-based violence. This article builds on this scholarship by investigating restrictions to reproductive freedom and their connection to the depletion of women's bodies in the global political economy. Specifically, I use the Depletion through Social Reproduction (DSR) framework to reveal how the work of social reproduction is harnessed to service economic activity at the cost of rights to bodily integrity with the aid of religious fundamentalist ideologies that (re)inscribe discourses of female altruism such as the self-sacrificing mother ideal. Drawing on the case of the Philippines, I argue that the control of women's bodies is integral to the Philippines' economic strategy of exporting care workers in a competitive global political economy. This strategy is abetted by local Catholic religious fundamentalists who challenge reproductive rights reform at various levels of policy-making and legitimize the lack of investment to sustain social reproduction in the household, community and country as a whole. This article suggests that the neoliberal global economy is increasingly reproduced through women's labor at the cost of their bodily integrity and reproductive freedoms.

J	George, N				George, Nicole			Policing "conjugal order": gender, hybridity and vernacular security in Fiji	INTERNATIONAL FEMINIST JOURNAL OF POLITICS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	4th Annual International Feminist Journal of Politics (IFJP) Conference	JUN 18-19, 2015	Univ Queensland, Brisbane, AUSTRALIA		Univ Queensland	Gender; security; policing; Pacific Islands; hybridity; violence against women	POST-CONFLICT BOUGAINVILLE	This article develops a feminist critique of debate on hybrid forms of governance in global politics by demonstrating the gendered implications (and limitations) of hybridized approaches to security provision. The conceptual approach that frames my enquiry puts arguments advancing the benefits of multilayered and hybridized security into dialogue with ethnographic enquiry on vernacular security and feminist study of conjugal order. I contend that this conceptual approach is particularly productive for examining the gendered policing outcomes that can be produced in environments where vernacular influences - customary and religious - inflect prevailing idioms of security and order. To further defend this claim, I apply this conceptual approach to a case study of gender and policing in Fiji. Although there has been a strong state rhetoric of progressive reform on gender policy in this context, efforts to reform policing have been hamstrung by longstanding customary and religious discourses that emphasize the defense of conjugal norms as foundational to the achievement of order and safety. I show how this scenario has encouraged a practical policing of gender and sexuality that is restrictive for women generally and may expose particular groups of women to direct forms of insecurity and violence.

This study investigates if having a woman at the helm of country's decision making processes leads to better indicators on women's conditions. Using time-series observations for the period 2000-11, we test the hypothesis with the Liberian experience. We analyse six main gender indicators: gender equality, equality of representation in rural areas (basic community), economic rights of women, participation of women in active life, political rights of women and legislations for the protection of women against violence. Our findings do not show substantially significant changes between the first mandate of Ellen Johnson Sirleaf and the period before. In essence, we only notice positive and statistical ruptures for equality of representation in rural areas and the economic rights of women. Policy implications are discussed.

Each of these social forces shapes the reproductive landscape, relates differently to women's identities, and causes different social stigmatization and harm. Pronatalism and geneticism warrant feminist concern because they can compromise some women's reproductive autonomy and well-being. I suggest that combating pronatalism and geneticism will require different sets of media, policy, education, and health care practice strategies.

We explore possible reasons for higher rates of harms to women, including systematic biases in health research and device regulation. Given that these factors are readily identifiable, we look to feminist scholarship to understand what might maintain them, including the role of cultural factors within surgery, such as gendered communication patterns and sexism. We then canvas potential measures to mitigate the increased risk of harms faced by women who use implanted devices.

This research examined the association between abused women's (N = 755) protective strategies at baseline and her partner's threats, stalking, and moderate and severe violence 8 months later. Emergency domestic violence shelter and orders of protection significantly reduced subsequent abuse. Receiving medical treatment was associated with a significant increase in violence, and security devices (e.g., mace, changing locks) with an increase in stalking. Safety planning and other strategies had no statistical association with abuse at follow-up. Future research should continue to examine the efficacy of safety strategies.

We assessed the feasibility, acceptability, and safety of CHW outreach in four urban community health clinics and characterized the experiences and barriers to providing safe and effective services for women experiencing IPV. CHWs successfully enrolled and engaged IPV victims, who indicated satisfaction and increased safety with program participation. However, complex psychosocial barriers prevented many from achieving safety and security. More work is needed to assess the impact of well-integrated IPV-trained CHWs in primary care medical homes.

Surprisingly little is known about the experience of advocates working in IPV-focused agencies who are survivors themselves. This qualitative study uses the grounded theory method to analyze interviews with 22 women working in IPV-focused agencies. The sample, more than 80% survivors, discussed how their work affected their experience through calling them to organizations, helping them to name the experience of violence, offering points of connection, and leading to an integration of professional and private experience. Implications for agencies and further research are discussed.

Propensity score matching is used to generate a casual estimate of the impact of women's roles as household financial managers on their experiences of IPV. Findings demonstrate that managing household finances independently significantly increased the severity of IPV women experienced from their partners compared with women who managed finances jointly with partners. Findings reinforce the importance of explicit attention to intrahousehold power dynamics and gender norms in the implementation of microfinance interventions intended to empower women.

Empirical evidence suggests that sexist individuals are also more accepting of violence in social relationships than non-sexist individuals. Results from multilevel regression models of data from 72,730 respondents of 51 countries around the world showed that (a) both sexism and acceptability of general violence in social relationships were positively related to acceptability of IPV and (b) the highest levels of acceptability of IPV were found among those sexist individuals who also present positive attitudes toward the use of violence in social relationships.

Findings from three focus groups with 25 Black and White adolescent women uncovered a perceived overarching force that "pushed" them to have sex before they felt ready. Participants identified four domains of coerced sex: (a) Sociocultural Context, (b) Internalized Sexual Scripts, (c) Partner Manipulation of Sexual Scripts, and (d) Developmental Status. Coerced sex was a complex system consisting of cultural, peer, and internal messages that create pressures to engage in sexual activities. Future implications for research and practice are presented.

Changes in Rural Korean Couples' Decision-Making Patterns: A Longitudinal Study	ASIAN WOMEN			English	Article						rural Korea; couples' decision-making; gender roles	GENDER RELATIONS; SOUTH-KOREA; WOMEN; ALLOCATION; BEHAVIOR	Korea has experienced ever-increasing numbers of women entering the labor force. Rural families particularly are impacted by these transitions, which may shift family dynamics and power, as evidenced in couples' decision-making patterns. This longitudinal panel study of 1,870 rural Korean farm and nonfarm households in 2000, 2005, and 2009 examines the degree to which couples' decision-making practices changed during the decade along three dimensions: agricultural work, family life, and domestic work. Wives in farm households significantly increased their participation in joint decision-making in agricultural work and family life. However, money management decisions remained mostly with husbands in both farm and nonfarm households. Husbands' participation in domestic work decision-making was unchanged, even though they increased their involvement in childcare and house cleaning. Implications are offered for policy makers and practitioners working with rural Korean families on the benefits of women's empowerment and equality in couples' decision-making.

Based on a content analysis of 2,972 Japanese television advertisements from 1997 and 2007, we identified gender stereotypes of older people including a higher percentage of depicted older males than older females, more females in advertising for the cosmetics/toiletries products, and males being shown more often in the workplace and females at home. Surprisingly, gender differences were even more pronounced in 2007 than in 1997, with even more males than females appearing in the television advertisements, and males being depicted more favourably than females. The potential effects of such representations on audiences are discussed based on social cognitive theory and cultivation theory.

However, less is known about women's mate selection concerns which have been shaped by this context This article contributes to the field in two aspects. First, it demystifies gan jue (feelings), which is a central discourse in contemporary Chinese young people's mate choice criteria and, yet, a discourse that has received inadequate attention in existing literature on courtship and marriage in current Chinese society. Second, from the perspective of gender reflexivity, the present study elaborates on how the emphasis on gan jue in young women's mate selection concerns questions of gender normativity and indicates the emergence of a new generational pattern of intimacy in China.

J	Karupiah, P				Karupiah, Premalatha			Voiceless Heroines: Use of Dubbed Voices in Tamil Movies	ASIAN WOMEN			English	Article						dubbing; objectification; sexualization; voice artist	WOMEN	Scholars have argued that sound in films has not been given much theoretical attention. Without understanding the use of sound in films, a comprehensive knowledge of the meaning and ideology of movies is not possible. This paper explores how heroines' voices are presented in Tamil movies and provides empirical evidence about gender inequality in the aural practices of Tamil movies. The data for this study came from a content analysis of 40 Tamil movies produced in India (1961-2012), 8 websites related to voice dubbing in Tamil movies, and 4 YouTube videos. The term "dubbed voice" refers to the practice of using a voice-actor or dubbing artist to deliver the dialogue while someone else acts in the movie. In Tamil movies, this trend has been common since the 1980s among female actors in lead roles but not among lead male actors. Even though the inability to speak Tamil is one of the reasons for this practice, it does not explain why female stars mostly use a dubbed voice. The male actors including non-native speakers often use their own voice. The use of a few select dubbing artists to lend their voices to heroines limits the type of female voices heard (from lead roles) in Tamil movies and narrowly defines the types of women's voices that are associated with someone who is attractive or good. Therefore, Tamil movies are limiting not only the looks that are showcased on the screen but also the female voices heard in these movies.

Gendering the Work-Life Balance Rhetoric in Canadian Tech Companies	GENDER WORK AND ORGANIZATION			English	Article						work-life balance; technology; organizational culture; human resources; Canada	MASCULINITY; WOMEN; ORGANIZATIONS; CONSTRAINTS; STRATEGIES; OVERTIME; CULTURE	This article is based on an exploratory study of the implicit gender norms in work-life balance (WLB) rhetoric in ten Canadian information and communication technologies (ICT) organizations. Interviews with human resources (HR) managers and preliminary company website analysis revealed a masculinist and heterosexist bias in the implementation of WLB practices, legitimized by the gender composition of the workforce and the demanding yet inherently rewarding nature of the ICT sector. Participants deliberately separated care (read: childcare) from WLB (read: flexible hours and working from home), reproducing the assumption that an ordinary' worker is a man with a female partner who assumes primary responsibility for the reproductive realm. The study concludes with: (i) recommendations to increase HR's role in providing functional support for WLB practices and (ii) three future directions for research. This article contributes to a general call in feminist scholarship to apply a gendered lens to WLB practices.

J	Lewis, P; Simpson, R				Lewis, Patricia; Simpson, Ruth			Hakim Revisited: Preference, Choice and the Postfeminist Gender Regime	GENDER WORK AND ORGANIZATION			English	Article						postfeminism; preference theory; choice; new choosing femininity	WORK; WOMEN; CAREERS; INDIVIDUALIZATION; ORIENTATIONS; ESSENTIALISM; ORGANIZATION; DIFFERENCE; FEMININITY; ATTITUDES	We revisit Hakim's influential preference theory to demonstrate how it is both reflective of postfeminism and generative of its values and practices. We differentiate between two interpretations of postfeminism - first a surface-level 'successful but obsolete' version articulated by Hakim and second a multilayered account of postfeminism as a discursive formation connected to a set of discourses around gender, feminism and femininity. Drawing on this latter version we make visible the embeddedness of postfeminism in preference theory, highlighting its connection to the creation of a new postfeminist subjectivity based on an agentic and 'choosing' femininity. We show how a consideration of preference theory in terms of the emergence and constitution of 'the female chooser' opens up aspects of Hakim's thesis that to date have been overlooked. In addition, our postfeminist reading of preference theory draws out aspects of Hakim's account that she herself understated. Specifically, within a contemporary context where equivalent priority is afforded to wage work and care work, it is Hakim's 'adaptive' woman who exemplifies the new postfeminist subject required to perform well simultaneously in both the work and domestic domains.

Based on rich data from a Danish case study, we adopt an integrated, holistic perspective on women's reasons for leaving the academy. We propose the concept of 'adaptive decision-making' as a useful analytical starting point for synthesizing structure- and agency-centred perspectives on academic career choices. Our study provides new insights into the myriad of structural and cultural conditions circumscribing the career ambitions and expectations of younger female (and male) researchers, at a critical transition point epitomized by high demands for scholarly productivity, international mobility and accumulation of social capital. Located within the context of Danish higher education, our study also adds to the current discussion of why academic gender stratifications persist in a country renowned for its leading international position on issues of societal gender equality.

Our aim is to focus on different forms of spousal support and explore how the support can evolve in the course of the men's careers. We are also interested in what kind of gender relations men produce when narrating their experiences of spousal support for their career. The research material comprises interviews with 29 managers who are fathers. In contrast to many previous studies, the results here suggest that spousal support is not a fixed or uncomplicated phenomenon but is constructed as various and flexible by men: negotiated, enriching and declining. The narrative analysis, in which we detected three different story-lines - romance, 'happily-ever-after' and tragedy - shows that the most positive narratives in terms of life satisfaction and career success were those in which spousal support was constructed as negotiated and men were willing to be flexible and adaptable in their gender relations with their spouse. More attention to a father's work and family integration is needed in the field of management and organizations.

Although research of gender in organization studies has revealed important insights into how gender might be redone or undone, non-white voices remain marginalized in this critical project. This article explores through in-depth interviews the ways by which Chinese cis-male professionals in Australia attempt to coopt desexualizing discourses and 'do' masculinity through sensuality. Specifically, the findings show how their sensuality is practised across various dimensions at work and beyond, including via the presentation of the self, relationships with others and representations in social texts. In presenting the voices of Asian men, this article seeks to illuminate their individual and collective pursuits for decolonization, agency and pleasure.

The results unambiguously point to the impact of the program, although its impact varies across groups, and suggest that the introduction of a statutory paid leave entitlement has stimulated a change in re-entry behavior to work: Women entitled to paid leave delay their return to work in the first months after childbirth; once paid leave entitlements are exhausted, transitions back to work become increasingly frequent.

Although there is a growing body of research on the benefits of gaining political rights and the costs of their denial, little research has focused on the effects of access to LGB-affirmative resources. In the current study with 1,017 women in same-sex relationships, we created profiles using latent class analysis to characterize the contexts in which participants were raised and the contexts in which they lived at the time of the study. We examined differences in interpersonal relationships, internalized heterosexism (IH), and outness across these profiles. Class 1 (28%) included participants who always lived in affirmative contexts with LGB-supportive resources. Class 2 participants (28%) always lived in more heterosexist contexts with few resources. Class 3 participants (44%) originally lived in more heterosexist contexts with few resources but shifted to more affirmative contexts. Class 3 individuals had greater social support and lower IH than Class 2 participants. Classes 1 and 3 had greater outness than Class 2. This study provides evidence linking IH to the lack of contextual supports. Our data also suggest that the quality of relationships for LGB women may remain strong even in heterosexist contexts. Actions that increase affirming resources will provide avenues for more positive identity development and interpersonal relationships for LGB individuals.

However, psychometric examinations of this measure with samples of diverse women are lacking. The current study presents the first investigation, to our knowledge, to examine the factor structure of the Feminist Identity Composite with two subsamples of sexual minority women (N = 402). We used exploratory factor analysis (EFA), partial confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), and CFA and found both the EFA and subsequent partial CFA (n = 201) indicated a six-factor solution, which was upheld in the final CFA (n = 201). The results generally corroborated four (Passive Acceptance, Embeddedness/Emanation, Synthesis, Active Commitment) of the five original subscales reported in previous studies with predominately heterosexual (or sexual orientation not reported) undergraduate women. However, the subscale Revelation was further delineated into two subscales labeled Societal Revelation and Contact Revelation. Convergent validity of the obtained Feminist Identity Composite subscale scores was largely supported by correlations in expected directions with measures of perceived sexism and heterosexism. We encourage future researchers to investigate the structural and convergent validity of the Feminist Identity Composite with other diverse samples of women.

Validation of the Interpersonal Exchange Model of Sexual Satisfaction With Women in a Same-Sex Relationship	PSYCHOLOGY OF WOMEN QUARTERLY			English	Article						human sexuality; same-sex couples; sexual satisfaction; lesbianism	HETEROSEXUAL COUPLES; DATING RELATIONSHIPS; SELF-DISCLOSURE; ADJUSTMENT; MARRIAGE; QUALITY; EXPERIENCE; SCALES; MEN	We examined the validity of the interpersonal exchange model of sexual satisfaction for sexual-minority women (SMW) with a range of sexual identities (lesbian, bisexual, queer, unlabeled, questioning). Participants, 898 (192 who were dating, 439 who were cohabitating) SMW in a romantic relationship of at least 3 months, completed an online survey that included the Interpersonal Exchange Model of Sexual Satisfaction Questionnaire. The results provide support for the validity of the model for SMW in that all the model components (relationship satisfaction, balance of sexual rewards and costs, balance of relative sexual rewards and costs, equality of rewards, equality of costs) were significantly associated with sexual satisfaction. All of the components, except equality of sexual costs, contributed uniquely to the prediction of sexual satisfaction. Neither relationship stage (dating vs. cohabiting) nor sexual identity (lesbian vs. other sexual-minority identity) moderated these associations. Women daters reported a significantly higher level of sexual rewards, sexual costs, and sexual satisfaction than did women cohabiters. The interpersonal exchange model may be used by clinicians as a framework for exploring experiences of low sexual satisfaction with a couple.

In four studies of Italian participants, we examined the symbolic association between agency and the rightward direction (Study 1, N = 96), its spontaneous activation when attributing agency to female and male targets (Study 2, N = 80) or when judging the authenticity of photographs of men and women (Study 3, N = 57), and its possible relation to stereotype endorsement (Study 4, N = 80). In Study 4, we used a conditioning paradigm in which participants learned a counterstereotypical new association; we developed a novel measure to assess the association between gender and spatial direction, namely, the spatial association task. Participants envisaged and cognitively processed male and female targets in line with the spatial agency bias model and reported lower benevolent sexism after learning a new counterstereotypical spatial association. Our findings raise awareness about the biased use of space (and its consequences) in the representation of women and men, so that all people, and especially communicators and policy makers, can actively intervene to promote gender equality.

Perceiving and Confronting Sexism: The Causal Role of Gender Identity Salience	PSYCHOLOGY OF WOMEN QUARTERLY			English	Article						gender identity; interpersonal interaction; sexism; social identity	SOCIAL IDENTITY; COLLECTIVE ACTION; GROUP IDENTIFICATION; STEREOTYPE THREAT; SELF-ESTEEM; PREJUDICE; PERFORMANCE; MODEL; DISCRIMINATION; PERSPECTIVE	Although many researchers have explored the relations among gender identification, discriminatory attributions, and intentions to challenge discrimination, few have examined the causal impact of gender identity salience on women's actual responses to a sexist encounter. In the current study, we addressed this question by experimentally manipulating the salience of gender identity and assessing its impact on women's decision to confront a sexist comment in a simulated online interaction. Female participants (N = 114) were randomly assigned to complete a short measure of either personal or collective self-esteem, which was designed to increase the salience of personal versus gender identity. They were then given the opportunity to confront a male interaction partner who expressed sexist views. Compared to those who were primed to focus on their personal identity, participants who were primed to focus on their gender identity perceived the interaction partner's remarks as more sexist and were more likely to engage in confrontation. By highlighting the powerful role of subtle contextual cues in shaping women's perceptions of, and responses to, sexism, our findings have important implications for the understanding of gender identity salience as an antecedent of prejudice confrontation.

Exposure to Sexual Economics Theory Promotes a Hostile View of Heterosexual Relationships	PSYCHOLOGY OF WOMEN QUARTERLY			English	Article						male-female relations; sexual attitudes; gender stereotypes; sexism; sexual economics theory	GENDER-DIFFERENCES; BENEVOLENT SEXISM; COLLEGE-STUDENTS; DIFFERENTIATING HOSTILE; TELEVISION PROGRAMS; AMBIVALENT SEXISM; BOGUS PIPELINE; FETTEROLF 2014; WOMEN; ATTITUDES	Proponents of sexual economics theory argue that women exchange sex for men's resources. This idea is likely to promote a competitive view of gender relationships that undermines gender equality by characterizing women as manipulative and financially dependent on men. Heterosexual college students (N = 474) who were randomly exposed to a popular YouTube video describing sexual economics theory increased their (1) behavioral support for sexual exchange concepts, (2) endorsement of the theory, and (3) adversarial views of heterosexual relationships, compared with a control group of students. Sexual exchange theory endorsement and adversarial heterosexual beliefs positively covaried, and both attitudes were related to participants' sexism. Reading a critique of sexual exchange theory, that emphasized mutual respect and affection as precursors to heterosexual intimacy, counteracted the consequences of exposure to the theory. The findings provide evidence that disseminating sexual exchange theory via video on the Internet negatively affects young adults' views of gender relationships. Educators, and others who wish to explore sexual economics theory through the use of this video, should also include a discussion of the countervailing evidence available.

The objective of this study was to examine gender differences in depressive symptoms among HIV-positive concordant and HIV-discordant couples. We identified heterosexual couples from participants of a randomized controlled trial conducted in Anhui province, China. A total of 265 couples, comprising 129 HIV+ male/HIV- female couples, 98 HIV- male/HIV+ female couples, and 38 HIV-positive concordant couples, were included in the analyses. We collected data using the computer-assisted personal interview method. We used a linear mixed-effects regression model to assess whether gender differences in depressive symptoms varied across couple types. HIV-positive women reported a significantly higher level of depressive symptoms than their partners/spouses. HIV-positive women with HIV-positive partners had higher depressive symptoms than those with HIV-negative partners, whereas HIV-positive men reported similar levels of depressive symptoms regardless of their partners' serostatus. Among the concordant couples, those with the highest annual family income showed the greatest gender differences in depressive symptoms. We suggest that family interventions should be gender- and couple-type specific and that mental health counseling is warranted not only for HIV-positive women but also for HIV-negative women in an HIV-affected relationship.

Condom-Insistence Conflict in Women's Alcohol-Involved Sexual Encounters With a New Male Partner	PSYCHOLOGY OF WOMEN QUARTERLY			English	Article						condom use; abdication; conflict; alcohol intoxication; moderated mediation	COLLEGE-STUDENTS; UNPROTECTED SEX; PROBABILITY SAMPLE; DECISION-MAKING; CASUAL PARTNERS; HIV PREVENTION; UNITED-STATES; EVENT-LEVEL; DAILY DIARY; BEHAVIOR	First-time sexual intercourse with a new male partner, relative to other sexual encounters, is associated with heightened risk to women for contracting sexually transmitted infections. Little is known, however, about women's condom-related decision-making processes during these first-time sexual encounters. In the present study, we surveyed a community sample of 179 women aged 18-30 about their alcohol consumption, desire to use a condom, perception of their partner's desire to use a condom, condom-insistence conflict, and condom-decision abdication and use during their most recent alcohol-involved first-time sexual encounter with a new partner. With structural equation modeling, we tested a cognitive mediation model with various configurations of alcohol effects on abdication and condom use (direct, indirect, and moderator). A moderated mediation model fit the data best. Women experienced elevated condom-insistence conflict when they wanted to use a condom and perceived their partner did not; conflict, in turn, was associated with higher likelihood of abdication and lower likelihood of condom use. Higher alcohol intoxication attenuated the associations of desire to use a condom, and perceived partner's desire to use a condom, with conflict. Results support an alcohol myopia-conflict inhibition-reduction model and emphasize the importance of sex education programs that not only teach young women about condom-related assertiveness and the effects of alcohol but also prepare them to respond to experiences of conflict that arise during sexual encounters.

Our meta-analytic review explored the cross-sectional, experimental, and longitudinal relations between fat talk and body dissatisfaction, body surveillance, body shame, pressure to be thin, thin-ideal internalization, body checking, and appearance-based comparisons. We identified 35 relevant studies via electronic databases. Meta-analyses provided effect size estimates based on study design and whether fat talk was the predictor or outcome of body image disturbance. Results showed that fat talk is related to a broader range of body image constructs than just body dissatisfaction and that accumulated evidence from longitudinal and experimental studiesalthough limited in numbersuggests it is more plausible that fat talk is a risk factor for these body image constructs, rather than a consequence of them. Nevertheless, the suggestion that fat talk may play a role in the causal sequence of body image issues highlights this as a potential area of intervention for researchers and clinicians. Given that fat talk is common and often well intentioned, awareness-raising exercises for parents and peers may be necessary to curb its incidence and impacts.

J	Roberts, MK				Roberts, Meghan K.			LEARNED AND LOVING: Representing Women Astronomers in Enlightenment France	JOURNAL OF WOMENS HISTORY			English	Article							18TH-CENTURY FRANCE; SCIENCE; KNOWLEDGE; POLITICS; HISTORY; VIRTUE; WOMAN	Using the example of Joseph Jerome Lalande (1730-1807) and his collaborators Nicole-Reine Lepaute (1723-1788) and Marie-Jeanne-Amelie LeFrangois (1760-1832), this article reconstructs the work done by women astronomers and examines how Lalande described them in his correspondence and publications. Lalande stressed their emotional sensitivity and deep connections to their family, but made clear that women's emotions fueled rather than conflicted with their scientific research. In so doing, he implicitly argued against assumptions that women's domestic ties made them ill-suited for serious research. Yet even as this rhetoric supported learned women, it also placed significant constraints upon them: they were not imagined as autonomous figures. Furthermore, Lalande's writings show that the bar was set high for "femmes savantes" (learned women). They could pursue advanced scientific research, and be publicly credited for their work, but only if they maintained a grueling double schedule of scientific and domestic work.

J	Kravetz, M				Kravetz, Melissa			FINDING A SPACE IN SCHOOLS: Female Doctors and the Reform of Girls' Physical Education in Weimar Germany	JOURNAL OF WOMENS HISTORY			English	Article								Focusing primarily on the discourse of those women doctors who were members of the League of German Female Physicians, this article demonstrates that women became involved in the reform of girls' physical education programs in the Weimar Republic's vocational schools by offering a unique expertise to aid young girls in matters of health. Female physicians claimed to be more disposed to answer questions about what types of exercise fit adolescent girls' bodies and best prepared girls for their future roles as mothers. Through their reform efforts, women physicians also revealed their own class biases in school healthcare, which often aimed at aiding working-class students and guiding working-class mothers in matters of health. By fashioning themselves as indispensable to the new subject of girls' physical education, and rationalizing their work through biopolitics, women doctors carved out a niche for themselves in a hostile, male-dominated work environment through their professional writing.

J	Poulos, M				Poulos, Margarite			"SO THAT LIFE MAY TRIUMPH": Communist Feminism and Realpolitik in Civil-War Greece	JOURNAL OF WOMENS HISTORY			English	Article								The prominence of the Women's International Democratic Federation (WIDF) in the arena of postwar international peace and gender politics is now established. This article focuses on the shifting trajectory of the WIDF's Greek chapter, the Panhellenic Democratic Women's Union (PDEG), as Greece slid from a precarious peace after liberation, to a full scale civil war (1946-1949). The PDEG witnessed a dramatic transition from its role as umbrella organization for the mass women's movement spawned by wartime antifascist resistance in Greece, to a vital support apparatus of the communist war effort, especially concerned with the plight of its ever-swelling female ranks. This article argues that the Greek chapter was far less of a "front" organization than a guardian of an increasingly endangered democratization agenda mobilized during the earlier resistance phase, which linked national political regeneration with women's active participation in the nation.

J	Freeland, J				Freeland, Jane			CREATING GOOD SOCIALIST WOMEN: Continuities, Desire, and Degeneration in Slatan Dudow's "The Destinies of Women"	JOURNAL OF WOMENS HISTORY			English	Article							SOVIET-UNION; EAST-GERMANY; KHRUSHCHEV; SEXUALITY; SOLDIERS; FAMILY; WAR	"The Destinies of Women," directed by Slatan Dudow and produced by the Deutsche Film-Aktiengesellschaft (DEFA), the East German film production company, visualizes the socialist moral economy developing in the German Democratic Republic (GDR) in the early 1950s. It highlights the centrality of regulating women's desires to the reconstruction of gender roles by the ruling Socialist Unity Party. Harnessing women's desires through a moral regulatory framework that relied on socialist values to determine notions of right and wrong was an important aspect of post-1945 reconstruction. It not only provided conditions for the creation of a new socialist citizenry, but it also served as a useful way to address competing visions of fulfillment in the West. This article examines "The Destinies of Women" as a lens into the ways in which women's desires were constructed and regulated through film and the role that desire played in legitimizing the socialist project in women's eyes.

J	Linehan, M				Linehan, Mary			WOMEN IN THE 1968 EUGENE MCCARTHY CAMPAIGN AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF FEMINIST POLITICS	JOURNAL OF WOMENS HISTORY			English	Article								In 1968, Eugene McCarthy's campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination brought new women into politics. United by a shared commitment to peace, McCarthy women helped to drive an incumbent president from office, opened peace talks with North Vietnam, nearly elected a maverick president, and permanently altered the power structure within the Democratic Party. Although their candidate lost the nomination, these women believed theirs was a victory with life-changing implications. McCarthy women confidently moved forward in the political realm because the movement encouraged and valued women's ways of organizing, empowered them with unprecedented opportunities for leadership and influence, and taught them to question the limits sexism placed on women's political participation. They created a Democratic feminist politics that endures today. The National Women's Political Caucus, Emily's List, and the careers of Barbara Boxer and Hillary Rodham Clinton are only part of this legacy.

J	Mickelson, KD; Biehle, SN				Mickelson, Kristin D.; Biehle, Susanne N.			Gender and the Transition to Parenthood: Introduction to the Special Issue	SEX ROLES			English	Article						Parenthood; Family; Gender roles	POSTPARTUM DEPRESSION; MARITAL SATISFACTION; RISK-FACTORS; FATHERS; FAMILY; METAANALYSIS; ADJUSTMENT; PREDICTORS; MOTHERS; WORK	The transition to parenthood is a rite of passage for most adults; however, given the dynamic state of gender roles in society, the parameters surrounding the ease or difficulty with this transition are evolving. The purpose of this paper is to introduce the work included in the special issue, Gender and the Transition to Parenthood. Academic literature has been filled with articles on how women cope with the transition to parenthood from a variety of perspectives, including a feminist perspective. However, much of this literature is dated and cannot account for how today's gender roles in society (particularly those of fathers) may influence the transition to parenthood. We argue that, with the rapidly changing gender roles in society, it is crucial to consider three perspectives in parenting: hers, his, and theirs. The ten works included in this special issue represent these three perspectives and seek to understand the transition to parenthood and its intersection with today's gender roles. Based on these works, the authors encourage researchers interested in the transition to parenthood to incorporate both male and female perspectives, as well as the interplay between the genders in making the transition smooth or difficult. Following a brief overview of the existing literature, we introduce the articles in the special issue. All papers in this special issue are based on U.S. samples.

New mothers, in particular, may use Facebook to practice behaviors that align with their mothering identity and meet broader societal expectations, or in other words, to "do motherhood." Given that Facebook use may undermine well-being, it is important to understand the individual differences underlying new mothers' experiences with Facebook during the stressful first months of parenthood. Using survey data from a sample of 127 new mothers with Facebook accounts residing in the U.S. Midwest, we addressed two key questions: (a) Are individual differences in new mothers' psychological characteristics associated with their use and experiences of Facebook? and (b) Are new mothers' psychological characteristics associated with greater risk for depressive symptoms via their use and experiences of Facebook? Regression analyses revealed that mothers who were more concerned with external validation of their identities as mothers and those who believed that society holds them to excessively high standards for parenting engaged in more frequent Facebook activity and also reported stronger emotional reactions to Facebook commentary. Moreover, mothers who were more concerned with external validation were more likely to have featured their child in their Facebook profile picture. Mediation analyses indicated that mothers who were more prone to seeking external validation for their mothering identity and perfectionistic about parenting experienced increases in depressive symptoms indirectly via greater Facebook activity.

Actor Partner Interdependence Modeling (APIM) was used to model the effects of the mother's and father's parenting stress at 6 months after birth on sexual satisfaction at 1 year after birth. Based on social constructivist theory and scarcity theory, two hypotheses were posed: (a) mothers' parenting stress will predict their own later sexual satisfaction whereas fathers' parenting stress will not predict their own later sexual satisfaction (actor effects) and (b) mothers' parenting stress will predict fathers' later sexual satisfaction but fathers' parenting stress will not predict mothers' later sexual satisfaction (partner effects). On average, parents were only somewhat satisfied with their sex life. The first hypothesis was supported as greater parenting stress significantly predicted lower sexual satisfaction for mothers but not for fathers. The second hypothesis was also supported as mothers' greater parenting stress significantly predicted less sexual satisfaction in fathers, whereas fathers' parenting stress did not significantly predict mothers' sexual satisfaction. We discuss how our results may be interpreted considering the social construction of gendered family roles.

Given the increasing number of dual-earner couples in the United States, new parents' attitudes towards employment (as well as the ways in which they balance employment and personal demands) may have an impact on their overall well-being. Based on anecdotal accounts, guilt about the conflict between employment and family (termed work-family guilt) appears particularly pervasive among U.S. mothers of young children; specifically, mothers, but not fathers, express high levels of a subtype of work-family guilt, that pertains to the negative impact their work has on their families (termed work-interfering-with-family guilt). However, little research within psychology has explicitly examined this phenomenon, and to our knowledge, no quantitative study has investigated gender differences in work-family guilt among U.S. parents of young children. In a cross-sectional, correlational study involving 255 parents of toddlers from the greater Southern California area, we coded parents' narrative responses to a series of open-ended questions regarding employment and family for the presence of work-family guilt and work-interfering-with-family guilt (in the form of guilt about the negative impact of employment on children). Mothers had significantly higher work-family guilt and work-interfering-with-family guilt relative to fathers. We discuss our findings in terms of theory on gender roles, as well as the questions they generate for future areas of investigation.

Doctors often recommend that couples attempt to conceive again after the experience of a miscarriage, yet little is known about the emotional toll of conception following miscarriage. In the current study, we addressed two primary research questions: (a) How does experiencing a miscarriage relate to recalled emotional experiences of uncertainty surrounding efforts to conceive again? and (b) does gender moderate the association between miscarriage and retrospective accounts of emotions surrounding efforts to conceive? An online sample of parents from across the U.S. (N = 429; 84.4 % married or cohabiting) reported their number of prior miscarriages and completed online questionnaires assessing recalled psychological adjustment (anxiety, rumination, positive and negative emotions) during their efforts to conceive their youngest child. In addition, they provided written responses regarding their experiences during this time. Participants' responses were quantitatively analyzed for word use using LIWC, a text-analysis software program, to obtain an observational indicator of emotions. For women but not men, miscarriage was associated with recalled anxiety, rumination, and negative emotions surrounding efforts to conceive a child, as well as the use of more negative emotion, sadness, and anxiety words when describing efforts to conceive. Thus, miscarriage seemed to taint the emotional experience of trying to conceive again, and this consequence seemed particularly poignant for women.	[Nelson, S.

Although some empirical research has examined the social consequences of adults' decision to be childfree, few studies have identified explanatory mechanisms for the stigma this population experiences. Based on the logic of backlash theory and research on retributive justice, the present research examined moral outrage as a mechanism through which voluntarily childfree targets are perceived less favorably than are targets with children for violating the prescribed social role of parenthood. In a between-subjects experiment, 197 undergraduates (147 women, 49 men, 1 participant with missing gender data) from a large U.S. Midwestern urban university were randomly assigned to evaluate a male or female married target who had chosen to have zero or two children. Participants completed measures of the target's perceived psychological fulfillment and their affective reactions to the target. Consistent with earlier studies, voluntarily childfree targets were perceived as significantly less psychologically fulfilled than targets with two children. Extending past research, voluntarily childfree targets elicited significantly greater moral outrage than did targets with two children. My findings were not qualified by targets' gender. Moral outrage mediated the effect of target parenthood status on perceived fulfillment. Collectively, these findings offer the first known empirical evidence of perceptions of parenthood as a moral imperative.

A sample of 325 undergraduate females responded to measures of previous victimization, problematic alcohol use, and maladaptive coping. They also rated perceived risk in multiple hypothetical dating vignettes. The results revealed strong relationships between problematic alcohol use and both decreased specific and increased global risk perception. In addition, previous victimization and maladaptive coping were related to increased global risk perception and specific risk perception, respectively. These findings carry implications for theories of risk perception and point to new approaches for research.

An ethnically diverse sample of undergraduate women (n = 408) were asked to rate how risky the situations were in terms of having an unwanted sexual experience. American Indian women rated the situations as more risky than did non-Hispanic White or Hispanic women. In addition, participants with more positive attitudes toward a range of sexual experiences rated the situations as less risky than did women with less positive attitudes.

Specialized research has resulted in deeper understanding of nuanced categorizations of sub-phenomena within both IPV and sex work, with parallel constructions along a spectrum of increasing danger. However, the scholarly construction of these continua as parallel-and thus unrelated-disguises the systemic nature of each form of violence and potentially pits victims against each other in the struggle for legitimacy. We propose a more systemic approach to understanding and researching IPV and sex work and provide examples of research already moving in this direction.

In New Zealand, however, victims often bring supportive allies with them to safety planning meetings, and those allies help to plan for the victim's safety. Interviews were conducted with representatives from 24 refuges in New Zealand, and from their perspective, the inclusion of allies in safety planning meetings is beneficial not only for social support but also for enhancing the safety of the victim. The benefits and implications of enlisting informal community members to help keep victims safe are discussed.

Participants (N = 103) were exposed to a misogynous song about IPV, a song critical of IPV, and a song that offered an ambivalent portrayal of IPV. Our results showed positive effects of the anti-IPV song, and both positive and negative effects of the ambivalent portrayal on participants' beliefs about a violent relationship. These findings suggest that the context in which IPV is portrayed should be considered when evaluating the impact of media depicting IPV.

The present study aims to enhance the understanding of the worldview of women within radical right parties. Taking a critical discursive psychological approach, the study looks at how female populist radical right politicians in Sweden and Finland discursively negotiate the tension between the Nordic societal norm of gender equality, on the one hand, and the patriarchal ideology of populist radical right parties, on the other. The analysis suggests that the female populist radical right politicians' discourse is indeed highly ambivalent. The discursive tension between gender equality and a patriarchal politics is heavily intertwined with two further tensions: first, that of a societal norm against prejudice versus a politics based on xenophobia; and second, that of a culture that cherishes individualism versus a political pressure to homogenize the political or cultural Other'. The study compares the discourse of female populist radical right politicians in the two country contexts. Moreover, it discusses the differences and similarities between this discourse, on the one hand, and that of male populist radical right politicians, on the other. Finally, it analyses the gendered and racialized categorizations accomplished by the discursive patterns, and elaborates on their societal implications.

Women's mobilization and bodily rights in Turkey and Norway	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF WOMENS STUDIES			English	Article						Abortion; activism; citizenship; Norway; Turkey; women's movements	POLICIES; GENDER; POLITICS; FEMINISM; REGIMES; EUROPE	This article focuses on the resurgence of women's movements in Turkey and Norway against the backdrop of their historical trajectories and wider gender policies. Throughout the 2010s, both countries witnessed a similar set of conservative and neoliberal policies that intervened in women's bodily rights. In both countries, women's movements responded with mass mobilizations and influenced the political agenda. The proposed restrictions on abortion were interpreted as a restriction on women's basic bodily rights in both countries. This article argues that a feminist, multidimensional reconceptualization of the concept of citizenship and a definition of abortion as an element of women's bodily citizenship rights are useful to promote a strong and encompassing argument for mobilization. The comparative analysis shows that the right to control one's own body has been a unifying issue for women's movements in Turkey and Norway which are gradually becoming more inclusive.

The discursive utilization of women's bodies and sexualities has appeared as the main tool to consolidate a conservative gender regime and the heterosexual family with children is promoted as the basic unit to reinforce hegemonic moral values and norms. This article aims to disentangle the intricate patchwork in the Justice and Development Party's (JDP) gender politics, which is geared towards ensuring pervasive control of women's bodies and sexualities. Within this framework, this article investigates the proliferation of the discourse on women's bodies and sexualities in Turkish politics by delving into the constitutive factors of the JDP's hegemonic gender politics and examining the narrative lines in recent public debates on women's sexualities.

J	Lee, E				Lee, Ellie			Constructing abortion as a social problem: "Sex selection" and the British abortion debate	FEMINISM & PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						abortion; sex selection; gendercide; feminism; Fiona Bruce; claimsmaking; social problem	PROLIFE MOVEMENT; CONTROVERSY	Between February 2012 and March 2015, the claim that sex selection abortion was taking place in Britain and that action needed to be taken to stop it dominated debate in Britain about abortion. Situating an analysis in sociological and social psychological approaches to the construction of social problems, particularly those considering feminised re-framings of anti-abortion arguments, this paper presents an account of this debate. Based on analysis of media coverage, Parliamentary debate and official documents, we focus on claims about grounds (evidence) made to sustain the case that sex selection abortion is a British social problem and highlight how abortion was problematised in new ways. Perhaps most notable, we argue, was the level of largely unchallenged vilification of abortion doctors and providers, on the grounds that they are both law violators and participants in acts of discrimination and violence against women, especially those of Asian heritage. We draw attention to the role of claims made by feminists in the media and in Parliament about gendercide as part of this process and argue that those supportive of access to abortion need to critically assess both this aspect of the events and also consider arguments about the problems of medical power in the light of what took place.

J	Eklund, L; Purewal, N				Eklund, Lisa; Purewal, Navtej			The bio-politics of population control and sex-selective abortion in China and India	FEMINISM & PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						abortion; bio-politics; bio-power; China; criminalization; India; sex selection	FERTILITY DECLINE; RATIO IMBALANCES; SON PREFERENCE; SAFE ABORTION; POLICY; PREGNANCY; MIGRATION; VIOLENCE; CULTURE; BIRTH	China and India, two countries with skewed sex ratios in favor of males, have introduced a wide range of policies over the past few decades to prevent couples from deselecting daughters, including criminalizing sex-selective abortion through legal jurisdiction. This article aims to analyze how such policies are situated within the bio-politics of population control and how some of the outcomes reflect each government's inadequacy in addressing the social dynamics around abortion decision making and the social, physical, and psychological effects on women's wellbeing in the face of criminalization of sex-selective abortion. The analysis finds that overall, the criminalization of sex selection has not been successful in these two countries. Further, the broader economic, social, and cultural dynamics which produce bias against females must be a part of the strategy to combat sex selection, rather than a narrow criminalization of abortion which endangers women's access to safe reproductive health services and their social, physical, and psychological wellbeing.

Theorists of abortion stigma have posited that entertainment media contribute to ongoing lack of knowledge about abortion care. Analyzing all plotlines that aired on American television between 2005 and 2015 in which abortion is considered (n=89), we examine how access to abortion is portrayed, whether characters are able to surmount barriers, and what documented real-life challenges to access are missing from onscreen representations. We find that 42% show at least one barrier to accessing abortion care, most frequently illegality, cost of the procedure, and social stigma. Almost no barriersincluding illegalityare insurmountable, and most are easily overcome for the characters seeking abortion. Some barriers, however, change how abortion is understood by a character such that she opts to continue the pregnancy. This underrepresentation of the difficulty of obtaining abortion care may contribute to public beliefs that abortion restrictions do not pose real challenges for women's access to abortion.

Whilst ultrasound images are increasingly common within the public sphere there has been relatively little public discussion of its role in identifying actual or potential foetal anomaly and the consequences of this. This paper examines how professionals working with obstetric ultrasound encounter, navigate and make sense of the different uses of this technology. Professionals commonly delineate their work (as providing information) from women's autonomous choices. Emphasising women's choice can obscure consideration of different collective ways of valuing foetuses with anomalies. It can also deflect consideration of the fundamentally ambiguous information that ultrasound can produce. Distinguishing information from choice is underpinned by a questionable fact-value distinction. We describe alternate professional practices which involve questioning these binaries and foregrounding clinicians' responsibilities for women's current and future experience. Public discussion of ultrasound's different roles in valuing foetuses would be enriched if the discourses and practices shaping professionals' attempts to facilitate ethical decision-making were included for collective consideration.

Although seemingly ideal, the current situation is a fragile one. Under current legislation, abortion is criminalised and legal access to it relies on gaining the approval of two certifying consultant physicians. In this report, we provide an historical overview of the social and political influences shaping New Zealand's current approach to abortion, considering the consequences of having abortion governed by criminal law. The situation in New Zealand is used to support a proposal that a pragmatic liberal feminist approach to abortion is best for women where it is a medical matter rather than a legal or moral one.

Abortion in the United States: The continuing controversy	FEMINISM & PSYCHOLOGY			English	Editorial Material						abortion; reproductive rights; women; United States; disparities in access to services		In the United States, abortion rates have been falling for several decades while attitudes have remained relatively stable. Given this background, this paper examines the current status of the fluid and contentious US abortion debate. Five relevant questions are examined: (1) What is responsible for the new wave of restrictive laws and what are their effects? (2) What is most likely responsible for changes in abortion rates? (3) What are the effects of the addition of medication abortion into the mix of abortion services? (4) What forces continue to fuel economic, geographic and racial/ethnic disparities in access to abortion services? (5) Why have gay rights been embraced by a majority of the US public and supported in legislation and judicial decisions, while during this same time period abortion rights have stagnated or declined? It is crucial for feminists to continue to promote the cause of abortion and other reproductive rights. Most important, however, is a focus on broader social issues for women (e.g., adequate education, affordable day care) and the underlying causes of unequal power in society.

Focusing on women's social and political activities, particularly in terms of the struggle for the approval and construction of a new road, I argue that in these communities, self-help groups offered a conceptual space that encouraged collective actions, and contributed to processes of change in the ways women perceived and experienced their personal power and their social positions within their households and communities. I demonstrate how these groups offered a way for members to add their voices to political struggles and articulate their visions of the future, even as they recognised everyday gender inequities.

Using the dataset of the third National Family Health Survey (NFHS-3) conducted in India in 2005-2006, the present study tries to find out the relationship between spousal violence and the prevalence of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) among women. How prevailing gender norms act as underlying factors of women's risk of STI has been discussed in this paper. Overall, 9.6 per cent women in India reported an STI/STI symptom in the year preceding the survey. After covariate adjustment it was found that, compared to the women who did not experience violence in 12 months before the survey, the chances of having an STI/STI symptom was twice higher for those who experienced only physical violence and three times higher for those who experienced both physical and sexual violence during that period. The findings of this study suggest that prevention of marital violence should be incorporated in the programmes that aim to reduce STIs among women.

Deploying the term feminist storytelling', the article focuses particularly on the origin stories that it diligently narrates. Feminist storytelling is to be understood here as a certain account-taking, a certain history-telling. It necessarily entails that we choose from a multitude of details; that we select and omit. It means that we plot different elements in terms of causality, sequence, consequence that we frame a beginning, middle and culmination. In other words, storytelling demands that we configure and constructa temporal range, definite perspectives, priorities, order, conflicts, tempo, significations and resolutions. This article zeroes in on two stories that are repeatedly called upon to mark the beginnings of women's studies: (i) the long fertile 19th century with its clamour over the women's question' and (ii) the tumultuous decade of the 1970s which witnessed twinned eventsthe publication of the Towards Equality report and the emergence of the autonomous women's movement. The particular manner in which women's studies claim these histories, the article argues, mediates present dispositions and the modes by which women's studies orients itself in the world. It conditions the responses we formulate under the sign of gender and in the name of woman. After analysing a few key renderings of feminist storytelling', this article quickly sketches a cartography of impasses confronting contemporary women's studies. Several of these, it proposes, can be traced back to the origin stories propounded by feminist storytelling.

BEYOND THE CHILLY CLIMATE: The Salience of Gender in Women's Academic Careers	GENDER & SOCIETY			English	Article						gender; work; higher education; discrimination; theory	FACULTY; INEQUALITY	The prevailing metaphor for understanding the persistence of gender inequalities in universities is the "chilly climate." Women faculty sometimes resist descriptions of their workplaces as "chilly" and deny that gender matters even in the face of considerable evidence to the contrary. I draw on interviews with women academics (N=102) to explore this apparent paradox, and I offer a theoretical synthesis that may help explain it. I build on insights from Ridgeway and Acker to demonstrate that women do experience gender at work, but the contexts in which they experience it have implications for how they understand gender's importance and whether to respond. Specifically, I find that women are likely to minimize or deny gender's importance in interactions. When it becomes salient in structures and cultures, women understand it differently. Placing gender in organizational contexts can better inform our understanding of gender inequality at work and can help in crafting more effective efforts to foster gender equity.

This article draws upon interviews with female programmers, technical writers, and engineers of diverse racial backgrounds and sexual orientations employed in the San Francisco tech industry. Using intersectional analysis, this study finds that racially dominant (white and Asian) women, who identified as LGBTQ and presented as gender-fluid, reported a greater sense of belonging in their workplace. They are perceived as more competent by male colleagues and avoided microaggressions that were routine among conventionally feminine, heterosexual women. We argue that a spectrum of belonging operates in these occupational spaces dominated by men. Although white and Asian women successfully navigated workplace hostilities by distancing themselves from conventional heterosexual femininity, this strategy reinforces inequality regimes that privilege male workers. These findings provide significant theoretical insights about how race, sexuality, and gender interact to reproduce structural inequalities in the new economy.

It is among the first to use straight men's own narratives, and helps address the underrepresentation of rural masculinities research. Through complex interpretive processes, participants reworked non-normative sexual practices-those usually antithetical to rural masculinities-to construct normative masculinity. Most chose other masculine, white, and straight or secretly bisexual men as partners for secretive sex without romantic involvement. By choosing these partners and having this type of sex, the participants normalized and authenticated their sexual encounters as straight and normatively masculine. The participants engaged in bud-sex, a specific type of male-male sex that reinforced their rural masculinity and heterosexuality. The married men framed sex with men as less threatening to marriage than extramarital sex with women, helping to preserve a part of their lives that they described as central to their straightness. The results highlight the flexibility of heterosexuality; the centrality of heterosexuality to normative rural masculinity; how similar sexual practices carry different meanings across contexts and populations; and the social construction of masculinities and sexualities by age, race, gender, time period, and place.

Mothers with disabilities are well positioned to expose the underlying beliefs about normalcy with which all mothers must contend. Drawing from interviews and focus groups conducted with mothers who have physical and sensory disabilities, I explore Deaf/disabled women's experiences negotiating the scientific motherhood regime. Illuminating a paradox, I argue these women are labeled "risky mothers" under scientific motherhood, which prizes the management of risk and the prevention of disability. Yet, these mothers are simultaneously rendered invisible by inaccessible and inflexible medical practices, and by a consumer market of expert advice which prescribes that mothers inhabit a typical body. These women's experiences illuminate the normalcy project as a central tenet of scientific motherhood.

In this article, we use interviews with 25 young adults (ages 22 to 32) to investigate the link between gender meanings, age meanings, and continued inequality in relationships. Middle-class young adults tell relationship stories in a gender and age context that both reflect and perpetuate ideas about adult masculinity and femininity. While women often tell stories of poor treatment in relationships, they are able to reclaim agency over their experiences and believe that they can solve their relationship problems by understanding their experiences as part of the normative path to adult womanhood. In contrast, men are able to explain their bad relationship behavior by attributing that behavior to youth and immaturity. By telling these stories, both women and men imagine that growing up will fix gender inequalities, obfuscating the persistence of gender inequalities in later adulthood. This work sheds light on the way narratives of age contribute to the persistence of gender inequality in romantic relationships.

The present study investigated perceptions, emotions, and behaviors toward women based on parental status. Undergraduate students (N = 299) rated women described as mothers, involuntarily childless, or permanently childfree-by-choice, then completed measures of competence, warmth, status, competition, emotions, and behaviors. Mothers and childless women were rated as warmer than competent, and childfree women were rated more competent than warm. Correlations demonstrated that noncompetitive groups were perceived as warm and that high status groups were perceived as competent. Warmth was more predictive than competence of most behaviors. In analyses of variance, mothers were the most admired group, eliciting helping behaviors; childless women elicited pity; and childfree women elicited envy, disgust, and harm behaviors. Nearly all relations between perceptions and behaviors were mediated by at least one emotion, supporting the primacy of emotions over perceptions in influencing behaviors. Mine is the first known study to establish that combinations of perceptions, emotions, and behaviors toward women vary with parental status.

Survey results in our study and elsewhere show strong gender disparities in anticipated pursuit of Physics after completion of compulsory education. In order to explore the constructions of gender and Physics underlying these trends, we focus on qualitative interview data, applying Foucaultian analysis of discourse to investigate gendered narratives underpinning adolescents' and their parents' articulations. This analysis reveals three key discourses at work on the topic of women's access to Physics: (a) equality of opportunity, (b) continued gender discrimination in and around Physics, and (c) Physics as quintessentially masculine. We additionally identify five distinct narratives supporting the discourse of physics as masculine. These various discourses and narratives are interrogated, and their implications explored. We conclude that it is only by disrupting prevalent constructions of the Physical sciences as a masculine and "hard" domain will we increase the presence of women in the sector. Working with young people to analyse and deconstruct the discursive assumptions made in relation to gender and Physics, as well as further work to increase accessibility and broaden representation in Physics, may be fruitful ways to challenge these longstanding associations between Physics and masculinity.

Girl in a Country Song: Gender Roles and Objectification of Women in Popular Country Music across 1990 to 2014	SEX ROLES			English	Article						Music; Women; Objectification; Gender roles; Stereotypes	LYRICS; VIDEOS; TIME; IMAGES; MEDIA; SEX; TELEVISION; SEXUALITY; EMOTIONS; EXPOSURE	Although content analyses have examined the portrayal of women in objectifying and demeaning ways in many forms of media, including several genres of music, little research has explored the portrayal of women in country music. The current study content analyzed the lyrics of 750 country songs popular in the United States across almost three decades (1990-2014) for their portrayal of female gender roles and objectification of women. Findings revealed that country songs from 2010 to 2014 were less likely to portray women in traditional roles, non-traditional roles, family roles, and as empowered than songs that were popular in the first half of one or both prior decades. Songs from 2010 to 2014 were also more likely to refer to a woman's appearance, to women in tight or revealing clothing, to women as objects, and to women via slang than songs in one or both prior decades. Furthermore, results indicate that the changes in the portrayal of women appear to be driven by changes in lyrics in songs sung by male artists, but not by those in songs sung by female artists. The present research helps to lay a foundation for future work exploring the relations between exposure to country music, female gender role stereotypes, and attitudes and behaviors related to objectification of women.

Study 1 indicated that explicit gender stereotypes are still attached to sport activities, with little variations according to personal characteristics but with a strong association with actual feminization rates. In Study 2, which focused on implicit stereotypes, we observed a slower identification of male names when participants were primed with feminine sport activities. In Study 3, neutral silhouettes were more frequently categorized as women following a feminine sport, but as men following a masculine sport. Our research suggests that sport activities are still gendered, both at the explicit and implicit levels, which may lead individuals to adjust their own participation even outside their consciousness.

The present study addresses this gap in the literature by examining alcohol use practices by men and women among a non-probability sample of French sport science students from five different universities in Northern France. We utilized both survey data (N = 534) and in-depth qualitative interviews (n = 16) to provide empirical and theoretical insight into a relatively ubiquitous health concern: the culture of intoxication. Qualitative data were based on students' perceptions of their own alcohol use; analysis were framed by theoretical conceptions of gender. Survey results indicate gender differences in alcohol consumption wherein men reported a substantially higher frequency and quantity of alcohol use compared to their female peers. Qualitative findings confirm that male privilege and women's concern for safety, masculine embodiment via alcohol use, gendering of alcohol type, and gender conformity pressures shape gender disparities in alcohol use behavior. Our findings also suggest that health education policy and educational programs focused on alcohol-related health risks need to be designed to take into account gender category and gender orientation.

Here, we examine the context-dependent prominence of intersecting identities including work role and gender ascribed to female soldiers in Special Operations. Using a mixed methods approach, based on 28 focus groups with 198 soldiers and a survey conducted with 1701 men and 214 women, we argue that female soldiers' experiences refute their male colleagues' assumptions regarding their ability to serve in combat units. The experience of identity in the workplace is different for men and women because women experience fluidity in their identity depending on with whom they are interacting and where interactions occur, whereas men experience and understand gender identity as a fixed, static trait. Although women experience the fluidity of their gender identity based on context, their male colleagues remain oblivious to the contextual nature of gender identity while also maintaining their authority in policing the boundaries of gender in the military context. Our research adds nuance to literature on identity, demonstrating the fluctuating nature of ascribed identity, which shines light on the socially constructed, artificial barriers to women's ascension in the workplace.

The gendered construction of agricultural work roles carries over into parenting. Farm mothers have primary childcare responsibilities, but fathers usually oversee the most dangerous youth farm work, namely work around large equipment. This study examined mothers' and fathers' work and family roles on family commodity farms, as well as risk-taking propensity, safety perceptions, and perceptions of youth injury vulnerability. Participants were 248 farm parents (124 married couples) with a youth aged 9-19 yrs. Mothers were less likely than fathers to operate tractors, less confident and self-efficacious related to keeping their youth safe, and less knowledgeable about farm safety. Off-farm employment of mothers had little effect on their home or farm responsibilities. Fathers, but not mothers, believed boys could safely operate equipment at younger ages than girls. Unexpectedly, mothers perceived less injury vulnerability to youth than did fathers. For mothers and fathers, younger youth age, lower risk-taking, lower safety self-efficacy, and greater knowledge about farm safety predicted higher perceptions of youth injury vulnerability. For mothers, experience operating tractors predicted lower perceptions of youth vulnerability. Mothers often deferred to fathers when making decisions related to youth use of farm equipment. Mothers' gendered roles and limited opportunity to gain farm safety knowledge may compromise their ability to work jointly with their husbands to keep youth safe on the farm. There is a need for communities to provide farm safety education to women who jointly farm with their husbands.

Yet, little has been written about factors promoting women's progress within the structural barriers that disadvantage women social workers. The combination of ethic of care, risk and resilience, and ecological theories informs the conceptual model outlined in this article. This model provides a roadmap for understanding national and organizational impediments to the success of women social workers and offers strategies for empowering women in the profession in the United States. Social work practitioners and administrators must engage in frank discussions about sexism, nurture leadership skills, and advocate for the elimination of gender discrimination and for the promotion of equal opportunity in social service organizations.

Utilizing the 2011 National Transgender Discrimination Survey (N = 6,454), this exploratory study analyzes relationships between homelessness and survival sex among transgender/GNC individuals. Results suggest these individuals experience homelessness at high rates, and their engagement in survival sex is associated with homelessness. Implications for social work are subsequently discussed.

J	Mollett, S				Mollett, Sharlene			Irreconcilable differences? A postcolonial intersectional reading of gender, development and Human Rights in Latin America	GENDER PLACE AND CULTURE			English	Article						Postcolonial intersectionality; feminist political ecology; Afro-descendant women; human rights; international development; Latin America	RACE; GEOGRAPHIES; LAND; STRUGGLES; ETHNICITY; RACISM; PLACE; WOMEN	In 2015, the United Nations set in motion the International Decade for People of African Descent (2015-2024). While this mandate provides much to celebrate, its reliance on universal and human rights narratives collides against the reality of a persistent inferiorization of Afro-descendant communities as less-than-human. The paradoxical nature of human rights discourses notwithstanding, Afro-descendant women (ADW) leaders in Latin America embrace the opportunity provided by the UN Decade, to rethink human rights discourses and Afro-descendant inclusion in development practice. I draw insight in this article from black feminist and postcolonial thinking to contribute to a growing engagement with the concept of intersectionality in the subfield of feminist political ecology. Employing the concept of postcolonial intersectionality, I reflect on how ADW operationalize particular knowledges and their racialized gendered subjectivities to challenge regional imaginaries that limit livelihoods, access to natural resources and that cast Afro-descendants outside humanity. I connect such organized activism to that of quiet, every day and largely unrecognized acts of resistance among Afro-Antillean women situated in the growing residential tourism enclave along Panama's Atlantic coast, in a place known as Bocas'. This article draws from ethnographic and historical data collection and is supplemented with news articles, activist scholarship, government documents and secondary resources. Together, I center the intersectional logics of power in Bocas and argue that ADW lead a material and symbolic process of place-making, one that prioritizes life while struggling over carnal, gendered and racialized dispossession and the right to be recognized as human.

In general in Europe and North America, and elsewhere, the trend has been for so-called vulnerable' groups or groups of people with special needs' to be seen after a time as groups of people with agency, with special contributions' and with capacities in relation to disaster risk reduction. This transition from victim' to stakeholder' has been observed as regards women, youth, the elderly and people living with incapacities or disabilities. The important contribution of our viewpoint is to document a similar transition or evolution of roles for lesbian, gay, bisexual, intersex, transgender and queer (LGBITQ) groups in the city of West Hollywood. The broader context of the city's site, situation, demography, exposure to hazards, civic culture and the organisation of public safety is also described.

This is a new phenomenon after many decades of female outmigration that also occurs in other European regions. Our aim is to explore how these professional women who decide to live in the countryside manage their work-life balance in this changing space. Our hypothesis is that these women, with high level of education and urban experience are more aware of gender inequality, have greater bargaining power, and therefore, achieve better work-life conciliation with their male partners. Research has been conducted through 60 in-depth interviews with women that have been analyzed through discourse analysis. The results show a complex situation. While these women are building the new ruralities with their work, skills, and insights, social norms concerning family responsibilities move more slowly. The research evidences aspects related to women's well-being as well as brings the broad issue of care at the center of the feminist debate.

J	Ferguson, JM				Ferguson, Jane M.			Discreet to excrete in the concrete jungle: women bike messengers and their inventive urban strategies in three US cities	GENDER PLACE AND CULTURE			English	Article						Traffic; bike messengers; work geographies; toilets; gendered labor		In spite of the radical changes brought in by new communication technologies, bicycle messengers are still integral to many urban economies throughout the world. While all messengers creatively navigate through dense, hostile traffic on the streets, women face additional challenges in this male-dominated occupation. They not only confront gendered expectations, difficulties, and harassment from co-workers and the public, but also experience struggles to access restrooms during their workday. This is an overlooked - but crucial - corporeal challenge of bike messengering: how, when, and where to excrete while on the job. The issue of restroom access is compounded by instances of gendered policing, based on a stereotype that a bike messenger is an aggressive male. Drawing from ethnographic research in two North American cities and additional interview material, this article will first offer an overview of the job and then examine how women messengers work in this male-dominated occupational world. Next, it will consider inequities of toilet access, gate keeping and belonging, and how messengers are excluded from office restroom facilities. Finally, it will examine rationale for, as well as the geographic strategies that women messengers employ during their workdays in order to excrete in (relative) peace.

It extends beyond research focused on the relations between gendered power, identity and the space of home, through a focus on food practices. Based on three case studies, this empirical research analyses how the gendered nature of domestic food work makes, remakes and unmakes the intimate relations between women and men. In particular, the narrated food stories explore how gendered domestic food work is undertaken in families with different forms and geographies of homemaking, creating intimacies even when families have to live apart. Moreover, the construction and reconstruction of the geographical terms of distance and proximity under the discourse of intimacy in the mobilised urban Guangzhou are discussed. The main argument suggests that both genders play important roles in the process of practising intimacy in the family sphere. This work contributes to the wider critical and cultural geographies of family through engaging men's agencies into the domestic sphere from a non-Western perspective.

Women on the move: theorising the geographies of domestic violence journeys in England	GENDER PLACE AND CULTURE			English	Article						Forced migration; exile; diaspora; rhizome; relocation	FORCED MIGRATION; UNITED-KINGDOM; GENDER; MOBILITY; COMMUNITIES; CHALLENGES; PATTERNS; POLITICS; PARTNER; SPACES	This article draws on a mixed-methods research project which mapped and quantified women's journeys to escape domestic violence in England, and builds on the empirical findings to theorise about the nature of such journeys. Identifying a process of gendered migration within the United Kingdom it explores these journeys using concepts of forced exile from international migration research; and concepts of rhizomic and dendriform movement within space. Tens of thousands of women and children within the UK are forced to relocate due to domestic violence every year, yet their journeys have been under-recognised in policy and practice, and under-theorised in terms of their relationship to other migrations. Using administrative data from housing-related support services to which women and children travel, and interview, survey and creative groupwork data from women who have relocated, the research enabled conceptualisation of both the individual and aggregated nature of the journeys. Empirically the journeys are found to be very individual and complex, with multiple segments; but including the possibility of women understanding the individual violation of their human rights within a more collective and structural context. The research therefore conceptualises these domestic violence journeys as moving from forced individual exiles, via complex, fragmented and rhizomic lines of flight, towards diasporic connections and processes of resettlement and belonging. Focusing on the early stages of such journeys, this article provides a theoretical framework which enables both a greater understanding of women's actions to escape violence, and an underpinning for preventative and service responses.			janet.bowstead@cantab.net		Bowstead, Janet/0000-0003-0194-7688	Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) [ES/I903275/1]	This work was funded by Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) [grant number ES/I903275/1].		62	0	0	3	17	ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD	ABINGDON	2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND	0966-369X	1360-0524		GENDER PLACE CULT	Gend.

It examines the crazy cat lady' as a discourse that entangles heteronormative and speciesist rules for loving, living, and making a home.' In a post-industrial moment when pet love has become a centerpiece of normal' life, the crazy cat lady occupies a queer periphery. She not only loves cats too much, she loves them more than humans, instead of a husband, and literally in place of heteronormative domesticity. To understand these complicit logics, this article reconceptualizes home as a queer ecology in which the sociospatial politics of nature, gender, humanity, sexuality, animality, domesticity, and intimacy collide. Using this framework, this article examines how women-with-cats-the real' crazy cat ladies-(re)inhabit normative ideals in their everyday practices and how this multispecies homemaking unfolds through more-than-human agencies. In queering ecologies of home, this article offers animal, posthumanist, feminist and queer geographers of home, as well as everyday homemakers, a wi(l)der bestiary of conceptual tools to understand intimacies that entangle across the boundaries of home/nature, wild/domestic, queer/straight and human/animal.

This study argues that the real women' imagery associated with the Western Body Positive movement reveals a pariah femininity' hierarchy: fat women achieve representation significantly more often than hairy women. In order to identify the stigma differential that might account for this representational difference, this study comparatively analyzes the parameters of stigma that United States viewers associate with each trait. A discourse analysis of online feedback from campaign viewers yields two important findings: (1) white women's body hair poses a relative threat to patriarchal gender ideology and (2) viewers associate women's body hair, more so than women's body fat, with feminism. These two findings have important implications for academic efforts to theorize corporeal stigma, hegemonic femininity, and feminist stigma management.

I examine how conceptualizations of race were reconstituted through the construct of disability to generate not only inter-but also intra-racial distinctions between differently classed white women. I argue that it was ultimately by leveraging a range of social categories-gender, class, race, and transgressive forms of sexuality-into a disabling paradigm that not only racialized women, but also poor white women were disempowered by eugenics.

Our community-based research affirmed the benefits of augmenting R.W. Connell's social theory of gender with a focus on the local. We explored how multiple relations of domination and subordination affect women living with HIV. A general inductive approach identified four themes pursuant to women's perceptions of gender relations, and how they affect their risk of HIV: power, emotional attachment, gendered division of labour, and social norms. Richer understandings of how power operates between genders paves the way for theory refinement, and innovative, refocused research.

Aesthetic labour of language workers	GENDER AND LANGUAGE			English	Article						AESTHETIC LABOUR; TRANSLATION AND INTERPRETING; KOREA; COMMODIFICATION AND ENGLISH	SOUTH-KOREA; COMMODIFICATION; GLOBALIZATION; GENDER; WOMEN	This article explores the intersections between language, gender and commodification in the Korean language market, in which the focus is currently shifting from language proficiency to personal aesthetics. By drawing on the concept of 'aesthetic labour', it explores how and why beautification has emerged as one way of enhancing individual competitiveness among English-Korean female interpreters who are engaged in heavy competition in the context of market saturation. This process is best embodied by the recent media phenomenon of eoljjang tongyeoksa or 'good-looking interpreters', which refers to a number of beautiful female interpreters working on television and sensationalised in the media. This paper examines how contemporary female interpreters cope with a market demand for performing beauty work in addition to language work in order to highlight aesthetic labour as a strategically gendered approach for self-commodification in a patriarchal language market.

The case of the Korean-English bilingual exemplifies how historically constructed models of personhood reproduce already existing gender politics. By analysing both macro and micro discourses, this paper illustrates how historically locatable models of personhood associated with female Korean-English bilinguals function as a kind of authoritative discourse in contemporary South Korean society to actively marginalise the increasing number of female Korean-English bilinguals. The findings of this paper challenge scholars in the field of applied linguistics and language studies to apply a historical perspective in order to explain second and foreign language learners' gender identity and display.

This article specifically addresses the unique issues surrounding the retirement of female baby boomers. Demographic changes, including increased labor force participation, coupled with declining fertility rates, have resulted in a social transformation of the roles women play in society. Despite these changes, women still bear much of the caregiving responsibilities in the household, which can complicate retirement choices. This article examines female retirement in the Canadian context and presents three policy proposals to expand women's retirement choices, encourage longer-term labor force participation, and thereby extend their working lives into the Third Age.

In this randomized clinical trial, 183 women with osteoporosis were treated with pharmacotherapy and weight-bearing and balance-training exercises. The case group additionally performed back extensor exercises at home. Patients filled out the Persian version of the Short Form (SF-36) QOL questionnaire at baseline and 6 months post treatment. At the end, all physical and mental parameters of the SF-36 questionnaire improved significantly in the case group, except for one subscale of mental health, compared to the control group. In the control group, only some physical health dimensions (bodily pain, role limitation, physical function, vitality), and mental health status as a mental health subscale improved. In conclusion, considering a major impact of back extensor exercises on improving QOL in women with osteoporosis over the long term, these exercises should be prescribed in routine management of these patients.

Yet there is a major knowledge gap about interventions that promote healthy aging in this population, as voiced by Black lesbians themselves. To address this need, 100 Black lesbians, ranging in age from 41 to 91, participated in focus groups in Atlanta, Georgia, to discuss their experiences of aging, health needs, and recommendations for interventions. Through thematic analysis, we identified six themes related to suggested approaches for healthy aging interventions. We discuss implications of these findings for aging practice and future research.

It aims to contribute to the study of this link in three ways. Firstly, it identifies defamilization/familization measures that have the potential to reduce negative effects of pro-market pension measures on women. Secondly, based on the examples from the United Kingdom, it shows that the government's willingness to provide sufficient defamilization/familization measures to assist women to deal with the negative effects of the pro-market pension measures should not be taken for granted. Thirdly, it suggests ways for tackling this problem.	[Chau, Ruby C.

J	Tomlinson, B				Tomlinson, Barbara			The Vise of Geometry: Distorting Intersectionality at the Scene of Argument	MERIDIANS-FEMINISM RACE TRANSNATIONALISM			English	Article							RACE; DIFFERENCE; WHITENESS; VIOLENCE; COLOR; WOMEN	Intersectional thinking emerged as a provocation in contemporary feminist studies as a political and analytic concept, a sensibility or disposition, a heuristic for thinking in supple and strategic ways about social categories and relations of power in terms of "both/and" rather than "either/or" (see Crenshaw 1989, 1991; Collins 1991). But in contemporary feminist critiques of intersectionality, it is frequently misrepresented, portrayed as fixed when it is fluid and flexible, and accused of creating the very categories and social relations it exposes and challenges. Few theories are as consistently misrepresented. The compelling conception of intersectionality proposed by Black feminists and other feminist scholars of color has a long-often ignored-history in scholarship and activism. In the 1970s and 1980s it represented a dramatic challenge to a white feminism that framed gender as the primary axis of oppression and white women as the primary representatives of feminism. Rather than welcoming this critique as a necessary tool for crafting a more capacious feminist practice, many white feminists perceived the emergence of intersectionality as a loss of power and prestige for themselves. This shock-seeming to lose control of a previously undifferentiated yet implicitly white feminism-continued to echo in the 1990s as white feminist scholars engaged in a series of interventions to counter and appropriate intersectionality. These interventions have become part of a chain of misrepresentations that continue to reverberate today through their citation, reiteration, and imitation (see Tomlinson 2013a, 2018). In practice, intersectionality informs, guides, and shapes advanced research in substantive and generative ways. But the relentless citational attack on intersectionality has made the term itself seem like damaged goods, often disavowed. These practices attempt to both diminish the luster of intersectionality and co-opt its prestige in the service of a revanchist white feminism. Such efforts are not the product of individual choices and errors but rather a shared social discourse pervading feminist scholarship, a discourse that is caught in continual reinscriptions of these arguments rather than reflecting on, reformulating, and moving beyond them. As a result, the valuable feminist tool of intersectional inquiry experiences a kind of stasis that needs to be overcome by transforming feminist tools of reading and writing. Critical feminist studies cannot allow arguments about multidimensionality and race to congeal around strategies that reinforce white women's symbolic domination of the field. In this article I examine two attempts to distort intersectionality through the trope of the vise of geometry.

Narrating her experience as a black Chinese American woman, the author reflects on having received anti-black messages throughout her childhood and how her need for healing has paralleled her work which challenges existing racial logic that casts Asian Americans as a model minority in competition and conflict with black people who are cast as social failures. Recognizing this racial/racist logic as one that allows white America to absolve itself from its central role in maintaining structural oppression, the author argues for the continued calling out of anti-blackness in all spaces-public and intimate, white and non-white-while carving out a path to empowerment, creativity, and freedom for herself and her daughter.

J	Todorova, MS				Todorova, Miglena S.			Race and Women of Color in Socialist/Postsocialist Transnational Feminisms in Central and Southeastern Europe	MERIDIANS-FEMINISM RACE TRANSNATIONALISM			English	Article							ROMANI FEMINISM; INTERSECTIONALITY; MOVEMENT; WORLD; POWER	Recent scholarship on Black American women and feminists in the radical Left documents how these women's travel to the Soviet Union and other socialist countries in the twentieth century influenced their understanding of racism, imperialism, patriarchy, and capitalism in the United States and abroad. This study draws from a related but ignored archive of documents to examine how the travel and knowledges of these Black women have affected women and feminisms in the socialist/postsocialist countries they were visiting. The study explores these affects in the encounter, in 1972, between a young Muslim girl in socialist Bulgaria and African American feminist Angela Davis. This encounter is linked to postsocialist Romani feminisms explicitly rooted in African American women's epistemologies of intersectionality to confront racism and anti-Gypsyism in the European Union and former socialist states in central and southeastern Europe. Women members of dominant majorities in Bulgaria, Poland, and Romania seek links to women of color in the Global North and South but their bridgework rests upon claims to racial innocence and shared victimization. The study relates these modes of socialist/postsocialist transnational feminisms to global and historical racial formations wherein Western racial sciences, colonial technologies, Marxist-Leninist imaginations, and socialist state policies intertwined to produce socialist women belonging to privileged ethnic majorities attached to racial Whiteness and European civilization, as well as Romani and Muslim women whose Otherness marked them for state-led socialist emancipation or eradication. These women engage with women and feminisms of color from the United States and around the world, and the consequences of these engagements illuminate possibilities for new and extended feminist collectives and political alliances that include women in the so-called "Second World."

J	Iromuanya, J				Iromuanya, Julie			Are We All Feminists? The Global Black Hair Industry and Marketplace in Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie's Americanah	MERIDIANS-FEMINISM RACE TRANSNATIONALISM			English	Article								The politically voiceless, economically visible, and racially indeterminate middleman minority status as noted by sociologists Edna Bonacich and Pyong Gap Min hardly comes to mind when scholars envision women of Africa and the African Diaspora. Still, when considering the ways the global black hair industry acts as a mechanism for work, production, value, agency, and mobility, we would be remiss if we did not include a discourse on the black hair industry, for it alternately critiques, challenges, and participates in binary conceptions of race, socioeconomic class, and citizenship. Further, while the traditional concept of the middleman minority subsumes the female identity under that of the male head of the family, the global black hair industry-largely established, fueled, and energized by black and African women-centralizes the female. Like many industries with a commanding economic force, black hair as an industry acts both within and without the bounds of the patriarchal state, macrocosmically, and the male head of the patriarchal family, microcosmically. Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie's novel Americanah, while concerned with her protagonist's mediation of the "Americanah" identity-the repatriated immigrant "with odd affectations, pretending to no longer know" home (2013a, 78)-also presents a unique observation of the ways that black hair and its commerce are also attendant, if not central, to notions of feminist ideology, both African and Western, advocated by Adichie in her feminist treatise "We Should All Be Feminists" (2013b). This paper seeks to illuminate the questions that Adichie raises in Americanah regarding the centrality and alterity of women, who, like traditional middleman minorities, act as consumers and producers within a market that is deeply entrenched in the racial, political, and economic framework of the larger patriarchal society, while also operating with a great deal of autonomy.

J	Weerawardhana, C				Weerawardhana, Chamindra			Profoundly Decolonizing? Reflections on a Transfeminist Perspective of International Relations	MERIDIANS-FEMINISM RACE TRANSNATIONALISM			English	Article							FEMINIST POLITICS; QUEER THEORY; UNSCR 1325; GENDER; SECURITY; PEACE; WOMEN; IR; KNOWLEDGE; CRITIQUE	In the interdisciplinary research area of Transgender studies, Transfeminist theoretical perspectives have witnessed much innovation over the last few years. 1 This has culminated in an increase in the acknowledgement of Transgender people in the West, as well as a growing affirmation of gender-plural identities across the world. 2 In the academy, however, Transfeminism continues to be sidelined, not making waves beyond the interdisciplinary research areas of Transgender studies and queer studies. The research field of international politics continues to subscribe to a cisnormative understanding of feminist politics. This article advances the point that Transfeminist thought, far from forming a fringe current, possesses the potential of being strongly informative, influential, and beneficial to the study of international relations and in advocating for comprehensive gender equality and justice agendas in world politics.

J	Ejikeme, A				Ejikeme, Anene			The Women of Things Fall Apart, Speaking from a Different Perspective: Chimamanda Adichie's Headstrong Storytellers	MERIDIANS-FEMINISM RACE TRANSNATIONALISM			English	Article							ACHEBE,CHINUA; NWAPA,FLORA; CULTURE; GENDER	This essay argues that Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie's short story "Headstrong Historian" offers a woman's perspective on the Igbo encounter with European colonialism, a history made famous by Chinua Achebe's novel Things Fall Apart who told the story from a male perspective. Through her short story, Adichie enacts the dual-sex system that scholars argue is at the basis of Igbo societies: Adichie does this by telling the story from the perspective of her female protagonists. In the process, Adichie makes two points: firstly, there is not a single story about the Igbo past; secondly, European colonialism had significant negative repercussions for Igbo women. The women in Adichie's short story-at least the non-Christian ones-are strong and independent individuals that take charge of their own lives. Adichie's characterization of women in "Headstrong Historian" suggests that the intervention of Christianity and European rule had deleterious effects on Igbo women's agency.

J	Makana, S				Makana, Selina			Motherhood as Activism in the Angolan People's War, 1961-1975	MERIDIANS-FEMINISM RACE TRANSNATIONALISM			English	Article								The assertion that the mid-twentieth century Black freedom struggles across the African diaspora was a masculine era is one that continues to strike a chord with many African women whose voices have remained absent from the rhetoric on national liberation struggles across the continent. In an effort to broaden and diversify the scholarship on African freedom struggles, which has focused inordinately on masculinist narratives from the Anglophone regions of the continent, this essay centers the experiences of Angolan women and their involvement in the 1961-1975 armed struggle against Portuguese colonialism. It pays particular attention to how nationalist movements deployed the trope of patriotic motherhood to appeal to women to join and support the fight for national independence. Focusing primarily on the maternal body, this essay argues that while women are often rendered invisible in national politics because of their relegation to the domestic realm, their presence as historical agents and patriots in the body politic of the nation is made possible through the figure of a patriotic mother.

J	Brunson, T				Brunson, Takkara			Eusebia Cosme and Black Womanhood on the Transatlantic Stage	MERIDIANS-FEMINISM RACE TRANSNATIONALISM			English	Article								A woman of African descent born in Cuba, Eusebia Cosme relocated to the United States during the late 1930s. She quickly became an internationally renowned performer of "Afro-Antillean" poetry, dressing in elaborate costumes as she recited the works of prominent poets who included Nicolas Guillen, Luis Pales Matos, and Langston Hughes. This article argues that Cosme utilized male-written texts, in addition to attire and choreography, to engage discourses of blackness on the transatlantic stage. The article compares her performances to those of her female contemporaries who included Josephine Baker, Carmen Miranda, and Katherine Dunham. It analyzes how Cosme employed a range of identity maneuvers that allowed her to challenge depictions of African culture as primitive, and to address the history and legacies of African enslavement. Finally, the article explores the ways in which various audiences-African American, white American, white Latin American, and Afro-Caribbean-translated her performances of blackness. Cosme's success stemmed from her ability to construct a nuanced representation of blackness within both Cuban and Afro-diasporic perspective.

J	Nwankwo, IK				Nwankwo, Ifeoma Kiddoe			The International Engagements of Working-Class Jamaican Women: Listening to Louise Bennett and Her Routes Women	MERIDIANS-FEMINISM RACE TRANSNATIONALISM			English	Article								Migration is a fundamental constitutive element of Caribbean life, culture, and identity, made so by colonialism, local and regional economic insecurity, and educational opportunities abroad. A plethora of scholars, filmmakers, poets, and novelists have indexed the migrant experience's beautiful-ugly complexities. As we discuss transnational migration as an element of Caribbean identity, though, we should consider the international engagements and worldviews of those who do not or cannot migrate "in fact," but do so "by metaphor," to use Kamau Brathwaite's terms (1993). Attending to them is especially important because those who are unable to physically travel or migrate for work-those left behind-have often been women. In the interest of establishing additional avenues for recognizing women's voices, the present essay examines international engagement that takes place in the absence of physical migration. It builds on and beyond the extant scholarship on Jamaican patwah poet Louise Bennett Coverley, widely known a Miss Lou, by indexing how her speakers' references to places and events outside Jamaica and to non-Jamaican people (routes) constitute a core dimension of her and her speakers' conceptualizations of Jamaican identity (roots). Miss Lou's poetry offers valuable departure points for critical recognition of the international interest, awareness, and saavy of Jamaican working-class women who migrate metaphorically rather than physically.

J	Henery, C				Henery, Celeste			And so I Write You: Practices in Black Women's Diaspora	MERIDIANS-FEMINISM RACE TRANSNATIONALISM			English	Article								This essay proposes diaspora as a love story-a tale of how black women create new possibilities for black collectivity through their writing. The experiences and affect of black women, born of their racial and gendered subjectivity, remain a less explored dimension in theories of diaspora. Black women's writing practices illuminate how they shift diaspora from a concept of separation, loss and exile into one that includes desire, communion and possibility. Engaging black women's autobiography and black feminist thinking, the essay sets forth an assortment of letters, phone calls, emails and poetry from across the geographic black diaspora to ethnographically illustrate how black women's diverse forms of self-expression reveal how they write themselves into relationship with other black women. These are the conversations of the sacred, the longings, sorrow and frustrations that are most frequently only shared in the intimacy of their writing. It is precisely these encounters and discoveries that convey how their searches for connection and recognition detail their praxis as one of love. Such examples expand theories of diaspora to include the experiences that generate intimate connections across time and space.

Examining black female characters' navigation of archetypcal environments in symbolically loaded vehicles and interrogating the representations of black women bodies as complex discursive spaces, the essay explores Barbadian women's struggles with latent colonial paradigms and highlights women's assertions of agency and their challenging of limiting constructs. Utilizing the theoretical insights of numerous transnational and African diasporic scholars, the essay foregrounds issues that have come to define notions of transnationalism, and it elucidates their specific implications for Caribbean women; these issues include representations of home and ancestral connections, negotiations of public and domestic spaces, and depictions black female bodies.

The novel's central characters comprise a blended family with Southern African American and Caribbean roots. They reckon with problems of social marginalization, alienation, and fragmentation, engendered by their various experiences of dislocation. While mindful of the diverse histories, values, and worldviews within black America's heterogeneous collectivity, Marshall ultimately privileges black women's perspectives on the limits and possibilities of traversing geographic and social spaces. Hattie Carmichael, the "City child" who occupies the moral center of the novel, embodies practices of cultural improvisation, self-determination, and intersubjective reciprocity; practices that make it possible for diasporic subjects to claim and assign meaning to the places and spaces that they inhabit.

Drawing on a questionnaire-based field survey of brothel-based sex workers from Delhi and Kolkata carried out between June and December 2013, it uses the capabilities approach to understand individual, occupational, and institutional determinants of bargaining power and well-being. The study considers bargaining power to be a latent, unobservable variable and estimates it using structural equation modeling. Findings indicate that both institutional and occupational factors play significant roles. The study differentiates between objective and subjective bargaining power. Some factors that play a significant role in determining objective bargaining power, such as years spent in sex work and residence in a brothel, may not play a role in determining subjective bargaining power. Conversely, factors such as marital status and caste play a significant role in determining subjective but not objective bargaining power.

It focuses on initiatives by UN Women, including the Progress of the World's Women 2015-16. Our analysis of the data compiled by UN Women raises questions about what might account for the over-representation of women among the poor in official accounts of poverty, and how this is plausibly changing (or not) over time. The paper highlights that analysis of what is measured and how needs to be understood in relation to who is the focus of measurement. The lack of available data which is fit for purpose questions the extent to which gender poverty differences are 'real' or statistical. There is a continued reliance on comparing female with male headed households, and we argue the move by UN Women to adopt the notion of Female Only Households reflects available data driving conceptual understandings of women's poverty, rather than conceptual advances driving the search for better data. Wider UN processes highlight that while sensitivity to differences among women and their subjectivities are paramount in understanding the multiple processes accounting for gender bias in poverty burdens, they are still accorded little priority. To monitor advances in Agenda 2030 will require more and better statistics. Our review suggests that we are still far from having a set of tools able to adequately measure and monitor gendered poverty.

It also examines how men and women justify or challenge gender inequalities in relation to access to agricultural information and knowledge. Data on gender and recruitment to and participation in training, barriers to training and access to information as well as farmer to farmer extension models were collected and analysed. A gender relations approach, focusing on power and inequality, was used to analyse the data. The data shows that the perception of men as household heads and women as carers or helpers who are also illiterate and ignorant often has implications on women's ability to access training and information. Negative stereotypical perceptions about women by their husbands and extension workers militate against women's access to training and information. Institutional biases within extension systems reproduce gender inequality by reinforcing stereotypical gender norms. Extension officers should be targeted with training on gender responsive adult learning methodologies and gender awareness to help them be more inclusive and sensitive to women's needs.

Analyzing 23 interviews in La Plata, Argentina, I find that the narratives of conversion and social pushback reported by women and men expose gender enactment and social reinforcement of the binary. At times, vegetarians compensate by drawing on scripts of femininities and masculinities that uphold difference, e.g. women cook meat and reassure meat-eaters; men make rationality-based claims and demonstrate strength. Yet in other moments, vegetarians defy attempts to hold them accountable to gendered social expectations. Women, for example, assert authority over their diets; men embody rejection of the meat-masculinity nexus by adopting a worldview that also rejects sexism and racism. I contend that in such a context, we cannot separate the ways people 'do vegetarianism' from how they 'do gender'. Doing vegetarianism in interactions drives social change, contributing to the de-linking of meat from gender hegemony and revealing the resisting and reworking of gender in food spaces.

J	Baylis, DL				Baylis, David Lee			Reorienting the nation: spatio-corporeal imaginaries and Turkey's father of modern obstetrics, Dr Besim Omer	GENDER PLACE AND CULTURE			English	Article						Pronatalism; queer theory; reproduction; spatio-corporeal imaginary; Turkey	EARLY REPUBLICAN TURKEY; MASCULINITY; GEOGRAPHIES; ISTANBUL; GENDER; WORLD; EAST; NEIGHBORHOOD; EUGENICS; POLITICS	In this study, I use a queer theoretical framework to critically assess narratives of reproductive reorientation in the early Turkish republic. I focus on the writings of one of the central medical professionals associated with the Kemalist regime, Dr Besim Omer. Inspired by Sara Ahmed's approach to orientation, I undertake a queer reading of Dr Besim Omer's writings on reproductive bodies and the spaces that they inhabit. Spatial dimensions of reproductive misalignment and reorientation are especially evident in Dr Besim Omer's work between 1923 and 1938. Rural and urban women are written as out-of-line with respect to the presumed national family line of Turkishness, one that extended Turkish bodies from the heroically fertile past and into a successfully (re)productive future. This assessment is predicated upon a spatio-corporeal imaginary: the naturally fecund Turkish woman, a body whose otherwise reproductively inclined tendencies had become misaligned in both the stagnating rural and industrializing urban spaces of the late Ottoman Empire and early Turkish republic. I draw upon Ahmed in order to highlight the slantwise character of desires for properly oriented reproductive bodies and spaces that were in-line with the nationalistic family line of Turkishness; desires that were predicated upon a placeless idealization and an embodied utopia. Spatio-corporeal imaginaries such as these have limited the scope and dimension of what constitutes, as Ahmed describes, 'a life worth living'.

Our research describes Southeast Asian women's experiences of mobility, narrating why they choose to be mobile, how the experience of going abroad was responded to and/or rejected by their family, how they experienced life in a different country, and what evaluations they make about these experiences in personal, familial, and professional terms. The article stresses the need to improve the understanding of the factors that are still determining the chances of women to be mobile and obtain fruitful gains from these experiences. For this to be attained, the article follows through an intersectional approach to mobility, considering it is of much use as it allows to comprehend that the disadvantages associated with gender are cumulative, multilayered, resulting from effects of several variables, including of the emotional, social, economic, and political contexts.

Nonetheless less is known about them in a transnational context, and femininities are far less explored than masculinities. Drawing on interview data from a larger research study of transnationalism and gendered HIV vulnerability, this article investigates the intersection of femininity, sexuality and sexual health risk through Chinese immigrant women's narratives about their experiences in Canada. It examines to what extent these intimate negotiations within China are re-enacted through Chinese immigrant women's transnational experiences in Canada. These women live 'in-between' China and Canada in terms of identity, space and time with their cross-cultural connections unveiling both virtual and actual relations. Gender norms and roles, intimate and sexual experience, and family relations are realigned in the transnational lives of these women and are impacted by both their home and host societies, as well as their past and present experience in China. Used in the article as a concept and an analytical lens, gender is acknowledged as a key organising principle in post-immigration individual and social experience.

Paying attention to and analyzing Mexican women's testimonios of intimate experiences uncovers why they migrate, how migration is experienced, and how migrant women frame their lives in the US. In this article, I compare how national and transnational policies of the War on Drugs in Mexico, which increased militarization of the US-Mexico border and created tougher immigration policies in the US (all in the name of US national security), form and transform intimate experiences of risk and (in) security across the migration journey for the same population. This comparative approach challenges and expands US-Mexico literature that does not read across experiences in the three sites of the migration journey.

Drawing upon semi-structured interviews with migrant women and participant observation within a women-led organisation, the article demonstrates the ways in which women's journeys from Myanmar into Thailand are also journeys of personal transition in which ideas of home are questioned and reconfigured. Developing perspectives on the geopolitics of home and bringing them into dialogue with feminist theorisations of borders, the article conceptualises home on the border as a site of vulnerability and potential in which participants can challenge gendered norms that associate women with reproduction, domesticity and the preservation of national culture. The article reveals a complex reality in which women negotiate multiple insecurities, developing alternative ideas of home while contributing to social change across borders.

J	Horowitz, LS				Horowitz, Leah S.			It shocks me, the place of women': intersectionality and mining companies' retrogradation of indigenous women in New Caledonia	GENDER PLACE AND CULTURE			English	Article						Hegemony; indigeneity; intersectionality; oppression; resistance; structural violence	GENDER; VIOLENCE; RESISTANCE; AUSTRALIA; GEOGRAPHY; ACTIVISM; PROJECT	Indigenous women's social positionings are complex and dynamic, informed by culture and post-colonial politics; gender and ethnicity intersect with age, socio-economic status, and social hierarchies. This article uses an ethnographic study of Kanak women's engagements with mining in New Caledonia, to examine three questions. First, how do indigenous women's dynamic social positionings shape their possibilities for negotiation with and resistance to industry? Secondly, how do women's possibilities for engagement in turn shape the wider community's possibilities for negotiation with or resistance to industry? Finally, what is the companies' role in shaping women's possibilities for such engagement? I draw on the critical feminist concept of intersectionality, bringing this into conversation with concepts of symbolic and cultural violence and hegemony. Over time, women began to actively negotiate with and resist industrial projects, in line with growing gender equity in New Caledonia, but the mining companies referenced - and thus reinforced - women's dominated social position as an excuse to sideline their concerns, a type of cultural violence I term 'retrogradation.' Thus, this article recognizes indigenous women's increasing agency in engaging with external actors, such as industrial projects, yet also shows how outsiders can commit retrogradation to further marginalize young, rural, poor community women. I discuss how such marginalization limits options for the larger group. Finally, I point to a way out of oppression, through transformation of hegemonic ideologies.

Drawing on research with women anti-mining activists in Peru and Ecuador, the article emphasises that their resistance is rarely concerned with large-scale protests, transnational activism, and the spectacular, but rather depends on daily resistance and resilience in, often fractured, local communities. I explore how rural women make extraordinary circumstances, including facing lawsuits and accusations of terrorism, part of their everyday lives, and how they articulate their resistance and situate it in place through narratives of staying put and carrying on, drawing on emblematic notions of rural livelihoods to challenge large-scale mining developments in their communities.

Experiences of displacement can provide significant insight into Newfoundland and Labrador's fractured political relationship with the nation of Canada. This article argues that Newfoundland outmigration must be viewed through the lenses of diaspora and intersectionality, as nationalist sentiment and the province's peripheral place within Canada affect women's experiences of outmigration. Tensions shaped by gender, ethnicity and socio-economic status affect their ability to integrate into Canadian society and influence their decisions about returning home.

Evaluating visibility of Nigerian female politicians in news media space	GENDER PLACE AND CULTURE			English	Article						Elections; Gendered Mediation; Journalism; Newspapers; Nigerian politics; Women politicians	BRITISH GENERAL-ELECTION; GENDER; COVERAGE; REPRESENTATION; PRESS	This study examines the spatial representation of Nigerian women politicians in the news media of Africa's most populous country. Through a content analysis of newspaper coverage of four high-profile women politicians during the 2015 electoral cycle, the study investigates the visibility of the women in three national newspapers. The analysis shows that women do not only occupy limited space in the news media but are also marginalised in political news despite decades of advocacy for gender equality. Although women have become more active politically since the end of military dictatorship in 1999, their participation and engagement in politics is not reflected in media coverage. The study argues that the degree of visibility of women in political news entrenches marginalisation and reinforces assumptions that 'only men do politics.' From this standpoint, the study illustrates how newspapers reinforce patriarchal understanding of politics and consequently highlights the manifest and latent obstacles that women encounter in the political arena. It comes to the conclusion that the relative absence of women in media spaces is emblematic of public perception of their political status.

They do so even when they face ongoing violence and personal threats from a variety of armed actors. Despite a well-established tradition of studying women's social movements in times of conflict, there is a lacuna when it comes to analysing feminism as a mobilisation strategy. This article uses the case study of the League of Displaced Women, the Liga de Mujeres Desplazadas (LMD) to illustrate the utility of Zulver's High Risk Feminism framework to explain how and why women chose to build the City of Women, despite the real and threatened danger that this implied. The article narrates the history of the LMD, from its foundations in a geography of marginality to its creation of a space of resistance for displaced women and their families. In all, this articles demonstrates how feminist resistance has not only become a way of life for the women of the LMD, but also a strategy for creating pockets of safe places in the midst of a conflict zone.

Analyzing data from the Voter Registration & Voter Confidence Assessment in Tunisia Survey conducted by the International Foundation for Electoral Systems (IFES) in March 2011 shows stark differences between men and women in their levels of political awareness, which causes a barrier to female political participation. Substantiated by a battery of tests, this gap is primarily structured by differences in university-level education and income levels. Contributing factors to explain the gap are differences in the degree of female public presence in urban settings, as opposed to rural areas, and a lack of access to information about politics. Policy recommendations to reduce this gap are creating educational funds for women and increasing the accessibility of political information outside of the capital.

The first suggests that candidates in perceived disadvantaged positions, females in this case, innovate to improve their chances of success, and the second, that female politicians often adopt stereotypically masculine behaviors to be successful. On the basis of these theories, we hypothesize and confirm that female candidates are more likely than males to integrate Twitter into their campaigns, but our results are less conclusive regarding a difference in the likelihood that females use negative campaigning tactics via Twitter. Our results also indicate that those females who use Twitter more than their male counterparts tended to do better electorally, but this difference is conditional. Female Republican candidates who tweeted more increased their vote share, but the opposite is true for Democrats. We speculate that this differential effect may be a product of different audiences for social media in each party's electorate.

Findings indicate that, based on immigration status and other intersectional locations, policy provisions differentially affect this population. In addition, because agencies focus on broadly defined populations (immigrants or women), but victims' locations are intersectional, intersectional policy analysis and coordination between and across agencies formulating and administering policies are required to meet the needs of abused Asian Indian marriage migrants.

This finding is important because bureaucratic perceptions are anticipated to have a gendered dimension, because there is ample evidence that women-owned businesses less frequently obtain external financing than do those owned by men. This obstacle to growing a business may therefore resonate more strongly with female economic developers if their perceptions reflect experiences and socialization processes shared with the women they represent. Results of an ordinal logistic regression model support this contention and contribute to the study of economic development and the role of women in the policy process.

The results indicate that gender, age, immigration status, family structure, and presence of children significantly affect the likelihood of SA exit. Interpreting these findings through a critical feminist lens, I highlight the structural barriers that potentially influence people's trajectories. Social policies that might better address the lives of women and other groups are explored, and a human rights framework is discussed as one avenue to advance poverty reduction efforts.

We continue that investigation with a unique data set that uses all campaign advertisements created by almost 400 candidates for Congress in 2010. In examining whether candidate sex or political party identification are the primary influences on the issues candidates present to voters, we determine that all candidates, women and men, campaign as strategic politicians, crafting campaigns around the issues of the day and adopting partisan perspectives on those issues. We find no evidence that women or men attempt to "play to" gender stereotypes in their advertisements.

We examine this major policy shift in breastfeeding promotion and public health efforts. Analyzing qualitative data collected from 214 expectant mothers exposed to differently worded breastfeeding promotion materials, we identify several overwhelming trends in evaluations of the materials by those women exposed to "risk" language. These trends, we argue, point to strategic and normative reasons to reconsider this policy shift to the language of risk.

J	Eldridge, SV				Eldridge, Sarah Vandegrift			Fissures of Empfindsamkeit: Tonal Shifts and Literary Depictions of Femininity in Goethe and Wezel	WOMEN IN GERMAN YEARBOOK			English	Article								This article traces tonal shifts between the comic and the tragic in Goethe's drama Der Triumph der Empfi ndsamkeit and Wezel's novel Wilhelmine Arend, oder die Gefahren der Empfi ndsamkeit against the backdrop of late eighteenth-century theories of femininity and sentimentality. Although Empfi ndsamkeit became increasingly satirized and pathologized across the eighteenth century, its literary depictions in the works of Goethe and Wezel highlight the difficulties imposed by the social conditions of womanhood. My reading of these two works against the grain of their prevailing affect aims to illuminate the ways in which what is, explicitly, a critique of feminized, sentimental characteristics can also implicitly serve as a more nuanced and sympathetic exploration of the conditions of women in the eighteenth century.

This article offers a close analysis of the play through the lens of Otto Rank's underrated theory of birth trauma. It especially explores the links between birth trauma and the violence against women committed in the sexual, social, and symbolic fields.

J	Quinn, E				Quinn, Erika			At War: Thea von Harbou, Women, and the Nation	WOMEN IN GERMAN YEARBOOK			English	Article								The outbreak of the First World War coincided with debates about the role of women in German society. Most female activists saw the war as an opportunity to broaden women's sphere of activity and influence. The author Thea von Harbou's fictional and essayistic works weighed in on the question. Although scholars characterize Harbou as a political conservative, their lack of attention to her bestselling fiction obscures Harbou's conflicted thought regarding feminine gender roles that she herself transgressed as a childless breadwinner. The author argues that Harbou's oeuvre reveals her profound ambivalence in that it calls on women to adhere to the domestic ideal, yet undercuts that message by presenting an alternative to it, the heroic "masculine" woman. Harbou's essays and fiction disparage women's domestic work as well as praise it. In terms of feminine gender roles, it's difficult to characterize Harbou as a conservative, as she called on women to break gender norms, including the comfort of male protection, for the good of the nation.

J	Bohnke, C				Bohnke, Christin			The Perfect German Woman: Gender and Imperialism in Arnold Fanck's Die Tochter des Samurai and Itami Mansaku's The New Earth	WOMEN IN GERMAN YEARBOOK			English	Article								This article examines the interconnection of gender, race, and propaganda in two German-Japanese filmic co-productions: Arnold Fanck's Die Tochter des Samurai and Itami Mansaku's The New Earth (both 1937). My analysis will focus on the female title hero of both films, the samurai daughter Mitsuko, portrayed by Hara Setsuko. By situating Fanck's film in the context of a longer Western obsession with East Asia, I will demonstrate how Mitsuko becomes the perfect vehicle for National Socialist propaganda, effortlessly embodying traditional values while appealing to a modern audience. Mitsuko's character is furthermore the site where Itami and Fanck's contrasting perspectives on Japan become apparent, with Itami utilizing the character to push back against Fanck's exoticizing gaze. Thus, these films, and in particular their representation of gender and race, constitute the site of a power struggle between Nazi Germany's depiction of Japan and Japan's struggle to assert its own self-image.

J	Steitz, K				Steitz, Kerstin			No "Innocent Victim"?: Sexual Violence Against Jewish Women During the Holocaust as Trope in Zeugin aus der Holle	WOMEN IN GERMAN YEARBOOK			English	Article								This essay addresses how in the film Zeugin aus der Holle (1965, Witness out of hell), fictionalized sexual violence against a female Jewish Holocaust survivor functions as a trope that exposes and rejects patriarchal and misogynist discourses of victimhood, perpetration, survivor shame, and guilt, which reviewers and scholars rightly have critiqued for such discourses' re-victimizing and re-traumatizing effects upon victims. I argue that as a filmic trope sexual violence served specific functions for its contemporaneous audience-Germans in the postwar 1960s. By means of the trope of sexual violence, Zeugin aus der Holle confronted contemporaneous West German audiences with gender-specific experiences of women during the Holocaust, the continuing trauma and re-victimization of Jewish Holocaust survivors in postwar Germany, and Nazi guilt.

J	Lusty, N				Lusty, Natalya			Riot Grrrl Manifestos and Radical Vernacular Feminism	AUSTRALIAN FEMINIST STUDIES			English	Article								This essay argues that Riot Grrrl manifestos were instrumental in promulgating a form of radical feminism that demonstrates the enduring nature of feminist radicalism. While a great deal of important work has been written on the movement, little attention has been paid to how these manifestos developed a distinctive political language and culture. By foregrounding the volatility of feminine youth and the historical erasure of the girl subject as a radical political agent, Riot Grrrl manifestos redefined the gendered (and ageist) exclusionary practices of the radical public sphere, promoting unified forms of resistance, often symbolised as a personal, albeit contagious, awakening to the realities of harassment, repression, violence and ridicule. This kind of molecular, contingent politics worked to exploit the contradictions inherent in young women's lives rather than to overcome the differences that had splintered more congealed formations of feminist politics. In rejecting the traditional claims of the radical public sphere, Riot Grrl manifestos insist on a vernacular feminism that strategically emphasises micropolitical action over grand narratives of resistance and revolution. While these manifestos draw on aspects of second-wave radical feminism and older forms of avant-garde culture, they push the genre of the manifesto into new territory by stressing everyday forms of resistance, defining their imagined consistency as porous and reactive rather than exclusive or over-determined.

J	Kanai, A				Kanai, Akane			Beyond Repudiation: The Affective Instrumentalisation of Feminism in Girlfriendly Spaces	AUSTRALIAN FEMINIST STUDIES			English	Article							CULTURE; POSTFEMINISM; CONFIDENCE; TELEVISION	As a mediated sensibility, Gill, McRobbie and Angela have argued that postfeminism is held together by an incorporation of feminist ideas, in order to position feminism as past', a positioning which contributes to the production of highly individualised subjectivities. This article highlights an emerging modality of feminine subjectivity in which feminism is affectively incorporated, but, rather than being repudiated, it is deconstructed and instrumentalised to fit within norms of girlfriendship. To draw attention to how this discussion may open a more nuanced understanding of the relations between feminist and postfeminist subjectivity, I explore a set of blogs hosted on Tumblr that are situated within girlfriend' culture. In these blogs, young women articulate humorous reactions to everyday situations based on assumptions of common, feminine experience. I suggest that girlfriendliness, as an emerging normative condition of youthful femininity, constructs an instrumental relation to feminism requiring the discerning, selective performance of traits suggesting an acceptance of certain feminist ideas. Rather than proceeding to a repudiation of feminism per a classically postfeminist sensibility, feminism is dismantled into an affective plasticity that is flexibly incorporated to show individual value, creating likeable' and resilient femininities. This article draws attention to shifts in the regulation of femininity that occurs on the plane of the affective, calling for an expanded analytical approach that more broadly problematises the instrumentalisation of feminism as a technology of subjectivity.

J	Mitchell, E				Mitchell, Elspeth			The Girl and Simone de Beauvoir's The Second Sex: Feminine Becomings	AUSTRALIAN FEMINIST STUDIES			English	Article							2ND SEX	This article traces the girl in The Second Sex [(1949). Paris: Editions Gallimard] as a necessary figure for understanding what it means to become woman. I argue that Simone de Beauvoir's overall significance and philosophical contribution is intimately connected to what she discovered by asking about this moment of feminine becoming. My central contention is that we cannot understand how one becomes' woman without first/also undertaking the task of understanding the situation of the girl. Drawing on the new translation of The Second Sex by Constance Borde and Sheila Malovany-Chevallier [(2010). London: Vintage], I offer a close reading of the chapter entitled The Girl' with attention to embodiment and temporality. In so doing, I seek to expand and refine our understanding of Beauvoir's philosophical project in The Second Sex; a project which launched a fundamental challenge to the meaning of being and gave rise to the possibility of a feminist philosophy.

J	Baker, J				Baker, Jeannine			Woman to Woman: Australian Feminists' Embrace of Radio Broadcasting, 1930s-1950s	AUSTRALIAN FEMINIST STUDIES			English	Article								This article demonstrates the crucial importance of the radio medium in the post-suffrage era as a space in which women could expand their sphere of influence and enact their responsibilities as citizens. It challenges previous scholarship which has argued that during the early decades of radio women were confined to the world of the everyday and the domestic. In the interwar years, Australian feminist organisations were quick to take advantage of the still-developing radio medium, which they used to publicise their activities to mass audiences. One such organisation was the United Associations (UA), founded in Sydney in 1929 by Jessie Street and Linda Littlejohn. Perth feminist Irene Greenwood was introduced to radio broadcasting as a member of the UA in the 1930s, and she later drew on these media skills and her extensive feminist networks to create her own innovative and interactive radio program in Western Australia, Woman to Woman (1948-1954). Correspondence between Greenwood and her audience shows that the program provided women from diverse backgrounds with the opportunity to engage publicly with significant political debates, to create a new imagined community of listeners, to communicate across geographical and class boundaries, and to become media producers themselves.

Drawing on three examples from the archives of Australian gay and lesbian history, this article offers an alternative glimpse of moments of solidarity from the time. What these moments reveal is that the question of fragmentation was a contested arena, where many sought unity over separation in order to fight common struggles around homophobia and sexism.

J	Slater, L				Slater, Lisa			A Meditation on Discomfort	AUSTRALIAN FEMINIST STUDIES			English	Article							FEMINISM	To borrow from Irene Watson, this is a meditation on discomfort (2007). I begin at a cultural tourism site in northeast Arnhem Land, where Yolu women were teaching Napaki (non-Indigenous) women about their kinship systems and responsibilities. The tourists were eager to learn: at times insistent and demanding. There was something too familiar about the scene: the settler women's clawing desire for Aboriginal culture', only just keeping at bay the anxiety evoked by Aboriginal autonomy and political will. My concern is that in this historical moment there is a retreat, a wariness to disclose what it feels like to be the beneficiaries of living in a colonised country. It is shaming to discuss these awkward, if not ugly, emotions, and much easier to dismiss these as personal failings, sweep them aside, or to hide behind empathy for so-called vulnerable people or an enthusiasm for culture'. Consequently those committed to social justice could fail to understand contemporary Australia, and also disregard an alternative feminist political practice. In this article, I reflect upon what might enable good white people' to stay in places of discomfort and be responsive and answerable to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people [Watson, Irene. 2007.

J	Kanai, A				Kanai, Akane			The best friend, the boyfriend, other girls, hot guys, and creeps: the relational production of self on Tumblr	FEMINIST MEDIA STUDIES			English	Article						Post-feminism; relationality; self; sexuality; friendship	AM I PRETTY; INTIMACY; ECONOMY; WOMEN	This article interrogates how youthful feminine selves are relationally articulated by reference to post-feminist economies of value on the blogging platform Tumblr. I examine a public on Tumblr in which everyday experiences in young women's lives are narrated through reaction-GIF blog posts. Combining GIFs and captions, the posts capture moments ranging from the rage "when I see some chick getting all flirty with my crush" to the self-satisfaction "when my bestie and I congratulate each other on being the most attractive betches in the room." In this context, post-feminist individuality is relationally made in two principal ways: through implicit assumptions of the reader as "spectatorial girlfriend" who is able to understand and "get" the references in the posts; and through the key social figures of the best friend, Other girls, hot guys, creeps, and the boyfriend, who are reconfigured as resources through which to tell a normative postfeminist self. Such techniques of conversion and use demonstrate not only that young women are labouring to demonstrate selfhood within frameworks of post-feminist normativity, but that post-feminist cultures also construct social knowledges which young women use to connect with imagined others.

It is important to examine how trolling is discussed within the media to understand how it might frame public opinion, debate, and action, and implicitly victim blame. The article presents findings on the forms of (online) abuse and behaviours related to trolling in media reports, including rape threats, death threats, and body shaming. It also explores the media portrayal of victims of trolling, and the advice given concerning how to respond to trolls. To comply with the message to women, which is propagated in media and popular discourses: "do not feed the troll" means that "symbolic violence" is exercised with the complicity of the victim(s) of trolling, which has broader implications.

Happily (n)ever after: the cruel optimism of Disney's romantic ideal	FEMINIST MEDIA STUDIES			English	Article						Disney; affect; cultural studies; princess culture; love	CONSUMPTION; CURRICULUM; RESISTANCE; PEDAGOGY; VIOLENCE; CULTURE; LOVE	Drawing on Ahmed's articulation of the performativity of affect, we analyze how Disney love, as it is constructed in Disney Princess films, acts pedagogically as a "happy object" that orients the happiness of women toward the acquisition of love. We assert that the happiness we derive from loving Disney is a form of what Berlant calls "cruel optimism," in which we become attached to fantasies of happiness and fulfillment that are unsustainable and detrimental. The cruel optimism we learn from Disney Princess films manifests as an incitement to pursue an impossible ideal of romantic love, or what Heise calls a bridal fiction, that reinforces the supremacy of a white heteropatriarchal family ideal and keeps us attached to "compromised conditions of possibility" that limit female agency and impede social progress.

News coverage in 2012 of a photo of two air-force mothers breastfeeding negatively characterized it as controversial. The news framing in 2015 of a similar picture of 10 army mothers was more positive, presenting it as progressive. This analysis investigated whether the audience responses to the visuals evolved along with the media narrative, and it examined which Discourses were deployed by commenters to critique the military mothers. Discourses of Good Motherhood, the Good Worker, and Sexuality were all found to fuel distain for breastfeeding in public, while Discourses of Military Masculinity, Masculine Nationalism, and Women's Progress Undermines the Military were aimed specifically at breastfeeding servicewomen.

Women's experiences of viewing lesbians on screen	FEMINIST MEDIA STUDIES			English	Article						Gender; sexuality; cinema; lesbian; women-only	RETHINKING; GENDER; SPACES; MEDIA	While critical analyses of media representations of lesbians continue to grow, less attention is paid to audience responses to those representations. This paper explores women's experiences of viewing lesbians on screen, analysing qualitative data from focus groups with audiences of a women-only film season screened in a UK cinema: "Lesbians on Screen: How Far Have We Come?" We consider how the internalisation of the "male gaze" complicates some women's viewing of lesbian characters and how women attempt to challenge and resist that gaze through their viewing practices and strategies. We discuss audience creativity in re-signifying representations of women, as well as other strategies including choosing to view privately or in women-only spaces. These acts of resistance disrupt the dominance of the male gaze, patriarchal cinema spaces, and reception of images on screen. By examining women's reflections on the experience of being in a women-only audience, a unique cinema space that "felt free" of conventional constraints of heteronormativity and patriarchy, this paper also examines how the gendered cinema space affects audience experiences.

J	Brzenchek, A; Castaneda, M				Brzenchek, Alison; Castaneda, Mari			The Real Housewives, gendered affluence, and the rise of the docusoap	FEMINIST MEDIA STUDIES			English	Article						Gendered affluence; white privilege; women's television; Bravo; The Real Housewives	TELEVISION; CULTURE; IRONY	In this paper we position gendered affluence as a representational trend in dramatic comedies (e.g., Sex and the City [SATC]) and docusoaps (e.g., The Real Housewives [TRH]) that coalesces around themes like hyper-femininity, nouveau riche values, and conspicuous lifestyle. Through our analysis we suggest that institutional practices (identity politics, cybernetic commodification, and post-feminist technological interactivity) situated in a neoliberal context and a remediated environment enable the systematic reproduction of gendered affluence in the broader landscape of women's television. The process of remediation is used as a lens to examine how the docusoap differs from (the immediacy of mediated self-performance) and resembles (the hypermediacy of mediated irony and post-feminist interactivity) the fictional portrayals of gendered affluence found in dramatic comedies like SATC. Our case analysis of TRH demonstrates the specific way non-fictional portrayals of gendered affluence are transforming genre (via an ethos of affluence and a consumerist ethic) and artfully maintaining the status quo in terms of gendered, raced, and classed intersections. Ultimately we argue that the docusoap is accomplishing this in a remediated environment that promotes a neoliberal agenda via affective engagement grounded in mediated self-performance and rational disengagement grounded in mediated irony.

While utilizing Erving Goffman's Gender Advertisements as an analytical framework, the study focuses on the visual legacy of gender ritualization that is salient in contemporary mass media, proposing five semiotic codes to concretely analyze it. Although Goffman's gender posing is traditionally associated with female vulnerability and indolence, the study proposes that such qualities are exploited as indicators of luxury within Western visual culture and advertising specifically. It seeks to deconstruct and re-frame the interconnected connotations of luxury and gender display, both expanding Goffman's framework and providing a unique interpretive resource for critical readers of media texts.

In this article we map a taxonomy of activist-research, illustrating how MARG brings together five specific methodologiesactivist- led issue-based research, militant participatory ethnography, feminist community research, prefigurative antiauthoritarian feminist participatory action research (PAFPAR), and autonomous media research-to study how women, people of colour, queer and trans people, and Indigenous people in antiauthoritarian or anarchistleaning social movements are using grassroots media to support and report on these movements. We find that although MARG set out to create an antiauthoritarian research-activist collective, we are restricted in some ways by the intensification of neoliberalism in the university institution. Nonetheless we are able to conduct transgressive research at the intersection between antiauthoritarian activism and the academy, producing three direct and immediate impacts: within social movements, within media activism, and within the university.

We codified four distinct forms of power communicated by the aggressive metaphors- power over, power to, power with, and power as-to investigate what these battleground metaphors communicate about gender and political power. Our content analysis and discourse analysis of the phrases applied to each of the candidates revealed gendered assumptions about political leadership. All three women candidates in our study-Flora MacDonald (1976), Kim Campbell (1993), and Belinda Stronach (2004)-were discussed as formidable foes, capable of using considerable force in their efforts to win. Indeed, Campbell became Canada's first and only woman prime minister. Yet, much of the aggressive mediation confirms the gendered mediation thesis that aggressive metaphors exclude women and reconstitute politics as masculine. Many of the combative phrases cast doubt on a woman candidate's ability to successfully compete on the political battlefield.

J	Perez, MPR; Gutierrez, M				Rodriguez Perez, Maria Pilar; Gutierrez, Miren			Femvertising: female empowering strategies in recent Spanish commercials	INVESTIGACIONES FEMINISTAS			English	Article						Popular Culture; advertising; gender; feminism; stereotypes		Advertising is a particularly representative case of Popular Culture. Recently, the terms Femvertising and Ad-her-tising have been coined to refer to female-targeted advertising that exhibits qualities of empowering women, feminism, female activism, or women leadership and equality. This article argues that companies producing these female-empowering advertisements show different degrees of commitment to equality, but in certain cases, they intend to manipulate users for bigger profits with faux activism. However, feminist strategies in advertising have the potential to disrupt gender norms, and users have the capacity to express dissatisfaction with such tactics. The research on the Spanish market is very limited; therefore, this article will explore and compare two contemporary advertising campaigns by companies Kaiku and Desigual to reveal strategies that in certain cases show progress in terms or the advancement to gender equality, but in other instances they reinforce inequality by the reproduction of stereotypes. A detailed analysis of the Desigual advertisement "Tu decides" illustrates the power of users to reject a pseudo-feminist campaign.

J	Galvez, AC; Tortajada, I; Willem, C				Caballero Galvez, Antonio; Tortajada, Iolanda; Willem, Cilia			Authenticity, personal brand and sexual agency: lesbic post-feminism on Youtube	INVESTIGACIONES FEMINISTAS			Spanish	Article						lesbic post-feminism; Youtube; youtubers; authenticity; Spain	YOUNG-WOMEN; GENDER; QUESTIONS; CULTURE; GIRLS	Youtube, the post-television medium par excellence, modifies young people's codes of representation and communication on issues such as identity and sexual orientation. The video platform has become the ultimate weapon of LGTBQ activism (Polo, 2016) where gay, lesbian, bisexual and queer take their stances. This occurs at a moment where post-feminism in mainstream media appears to be the only possible female representation: as symbolic backlash against historical feminism -used on many occasions by icons of popular culture- it claims liberated, assertive, and authentic women, but at the same time obviates the injustices of patriarchy still firmly in place (Tasker and Black, 2005; Gill, 2007). The patterns of post-feminist representations are linked with authenticity, success, freedom of choice and female empowerment on the one hand, and with sexual agency and women's use of their bodies in order to achieve privileges on the other. This study investigates how young lesbian youtubers in Spain reproduce and/or resist this mainstream postfeminism. To this end we have selected a sample of five Spanish lesbian youtubers with a large number of subscribers (YellowMellow, Dulceida, Xuri Fenton, Gominuke, Koala Rabioso). Results show how these young women manage their bodies and appearance outside the logic of the male gaze, thus generating new (lesbic) imaginary. This grants lesbian youtubers a sexual agency that is not framed in post-feminism, but develops its own language. On the other hand, one of the most important features of these youtubers is authenticity. An authenticity that is not only framed in the logic of Youtube itself, but is also more reflexive (Giddens, 1994) and more politically engaging than post-feminist representations, generally void of ideology. Although each of these youtubers creates a successful personal brand-whether or not linked to commercial brands- they claim authenticity as their main value and manage to maintain their credibility by managing their failures in a humorous way.

To do this, we propose an approach to television screenwriting in Spain, a field where women have made significant contributions, focusing on the works of Virginia Yague, creator of the fiction series la Senora (TVE1: 2008-2010) and 14 de abril. La Republica (TVE1: 2011-).

J	Garcia, PM; Aguado-Pelaez, D				Martinez Garcia, Patricia; Aguado-Pelaez, Delicia			Women's bodies reappropriation in television fiction, analysis of Orange is the New Black	INVESTIGACIONES FEMINISTAS			Spanish	Article						Feminist Critical Discourse Analysis; Female Bodies; Gender Studies and Feminism; Orange is the New Black; (Against)Violence in television		Traditionally, fictional television stereotypes women and it become them invisible because of a representation linked to pleasure of men, only like a passive object. However, the Third Golden Age of Television allows spaces to products that break this normative androcentric model, such as Orange is the New Black (Netflix, 2013). Thus, this research study the discourses about women sexuality and bodies through a Feminist Critical Discourse Analysis. In particular, it uses two paradigmatic episodes where these topics are dealt: A Whole Other Hole (204) and Fear, and Other Smells (308). In these sense, Jenji Kohan's drama allows to re-appropriate women s sexualities and bodies through a diverse representation and breaking the patriarchy's silences about female realities.

J	Menendez, MIM				Menendez Menendez, Maria Isabel			Women and Power: Amazons in Contemporary Young Adult Film	INVESTIGACIONES FEMINISTAS			Spanish	Article						young adult film; female warriors; feminism; gender roles; popular culture		Amazons are a female symbol that appears in art and literature, contributing to the construction of an imaginary of mythical and warrior women that has fed many popular culture products, most often from a patriarchal and/or phallic point of view. Nevertheless, we can observe the existence of some mainstream products that subvert this representation, elaborating a positive and emancipatory heroic profile. This paper provides an analysis of two recent works addressed at young adults: the animated movie Brave (Mark Andrews and Brenda Chapman, 2012) and The Hunger Games film saga (Gary Ross, 2012; Francis Lawrence, 2013, 2014, and 2015). In both cases there exists an unquestionable female centrality which, seen from a feminist standpoint, offers an alternative to most characters in the audiovisual industry, defined by sexism and subordination to the male. In this respect, both Merida and Katniss are presented as independent heroines with their own personality and agency.

J	Campoy, JC				Campoy, Julia Cabrera			Is it necessary to be a feminist to make feminist cinema? Iciar Bollain and her cinematographic representation of gender	INVESTIGACIONES FEMINISTAS			English	Article						Feminist film theory; Counter-cinema; Post-feminist cinema; Postmodernism; Iciar Bollain		Inequality between men and women in cinema has remained stable from its very start. Both behind the cameras and on-screen representation, women have been systematically made invisible, are underrepresented and have been objectified. The feminist efforts which arose in the '70s to draw attention to and challenge the existing power order worked through two axes: the critique of patriarchal society and a patriarchal cinema industry; and the development of feminist counter-cinema. Despite their efforts, women's situation has not greatly improved. However, from the '90s a stream of female authors has emerged who are considered feminists by the critics, but who disown feminism themselves. Their films, with strong capable women in lead, no longer represent women's straggles but assume their victories and create from them. New categories of analysis, such as post-feminist cinema, have been developed for these films. Nevertheless, I question whether these are not essentially feminist representations inasmuch as they are building alternative models of femininity. If they are, does this mean that a feminist consciousness is not necessary to make feminist films? In order to address this question, I analyze gender representation in Bollain's filmography, and discuss whether her films can be considered feminist despite her rejection to this term, and the implication this might entail.

Taking as paradigmatic the case of Beyonce, this text explores the intersection between mainstream culture, mass media and feminism, contextualized in the logics of advanced capitalism, neo-liberalism and its patriarchal rearmament and the celebritization of the media space in which they coincide. Its objective will be to expose, through the academic and media reactions to Beyonce's feminism, the strengths and weaknesses of the so-called postfeminism, and to propose that its utility as a subversive tool could be considered not in relation to the public that receives and reworks it, but in terms of its ability to mobilize and produce mutations in both journalistic and academic practice.

It helps to accelerate the predominance of cultural production as a construct agent both of meaning and of entertainment. A visual sequencing that allows an intense perception of a message in a very short period of time. From the phenomena related to the audiovisual production of women artists I will reflect on the performative force of the musical videos of pop divas and the drifts that can become in the social and political demands that occur in them. First, the role of subjectivation in the production and consumption of them. Second, the processes of socialization and performativity that articulate other social imaginaries for women and men and establish a different order in gender discourses. So how they contribute to changes in the production of culture, being also aware of mixed interests in a cultural mainstream environment.

However, only 17% of its creators are women, which implies an important loss of creative capital and high economic gains that are not equitably distributed in a context of social inequality. Multiple factors, from the content of video games to the social environment, negatively influence women, creating a disaffection for video games. On the other hand, the masculinized environments and the lack of authority of the women around the videogames, curb the pretensions of the players to make the leap toward the professionalization in this industry. The objective of this article, through a bibliographical review, is to begin a research of the causes of the underrepresentation of women in the video game industry, in order to find solutions, create a more sustainable economy for Europe, an increase of equal spaces And greater job opportunities for women.

The Spanish situation, after more than forty years of dictatorship, determined the campaigns of the feminist movement.

Some principal campaigns were to end to the penalty of so-called female adultery, legalize the contraceptive methods and the abortion, get the recognition and the reinforcement the equality between women and men in the constitution, the acceptance of a new sexuality model or a divorce law doesn't discriminatory for women.

The series was titled "Face cartographies" and was composed by eleven paintings that crisscrossed the faces of the artist with other women. In addition, on each painting layed a map who was performed by the artist with the woman portrayed, where both mapped their links in the portrait to name their symbolic realities. From these works, the author makes a tour explaining how the series originated, what experiences and referents lead her to take elements of cartography and feminism for these creations. Through this work we speak about an artistic practice that seeks mediation because it puts in the center the relationship with other women, to make visible the links between them as political practices that move in the field of arts. It reflects on how" new images created in feminist artistic practices can challenge traditional ideas of portraiture and well, the sense of lived as women.

I want to explore what makes it appear to be more violent than all the other higher learning institutions, why there is so much student protest, the gender roles in student protest, and protesters' view on feminist theory. I also want to reflect on my introduction to feminism and how I learnt to embrace the word. To me feminism means that as a Black woman no one should dictate on how I am to live my life or how I must behave, because that is what my gender requires or entails of me. It means that the society can never expect me to carry myself to fit their expectations. At this age I still find the term 'gender roles' so foreign. Feminism has been influential to my activism. I discovered that all the student protest that takes place there is led by male students and student organisations are dominated by males; in all the meetings we hold males are always more opinionated than female students, and male students continue to be in more powerful positions than women. Me being so outspoken and taking the forefront when protesting is seen as a taboo; I am labelled as an 'attention seeker' and as very disrespectful towards men just because I can stand up for myself and the other women. Some females also view me like that. In this perspective piece I seek to write about my journey in student activism and learning more about the feminist theory.

J	Shange, N				Shange, Nombulelo			Mappings of feminist/womanist resistance within student movements across the African continent	AGENDA-EMPOWERING WOMEN FOR GENDER EQUITY			English	Article						Ubuntu; Black Consciousness; Marxism; womanist resistance; Fees Must Fall		Feminist and womanist resistance in South Africa has not received the attention it deserves, considering the sacrifice women made during the struggle for freedom. Today sadly not much has changed. Women within the Fees Must Fall (FMF) protest movement have been a little more successful in shaping their own narratives, but unfortunately our ancestors could not do this; so much of the information about their resilience has been lost. Social media today plays a huge role in ensuring that this no longer happens. This perspective piece discusses womanist resistance by drawing on historical examples of social, political and even religious groups created or largely influenced by women. The historical discussion of the Alexandra Women's Council, Bantu Women's League and individuals like Pastor Clarah Maphumulo is juxtaposed with contemporary struggles of young student female activists. This has been done through a discussion about the University of the Witwatersrand naked protest, as well as by highlighting gender inequality within FMF. This perspective also illustrates how recent Fallism protest actions owe their origins to Ubuntu, which informs so many of the Black Consciousness ideals which revolutionaries value. It also maps out how Ubuntu influenced early activism against Christian missionaries and empowered African women to resist Western domination at a time when it was dangerous to do so. The spirit and passion of women acting against Christianity in the 1900s and against the State in the 1950s are the same that shape contemporary womanist resistance.

It contributes by showing the gendered effects of urban transformation on poor women as neoliberalism and conservatism interact. It draws upon two ethnographic studies that reveal women's experiences embedded both in neoliberalism and patriarchy. In neoliberalism, women's participation in the informal job market was promoted as they were made responsible for contributing to mortgage payments, and they were brought into consumption as they were provoked the desire for good homes via furnishing, and in patriarchy, women's traditional roles in social reproduction were demanded in spite of their new roles and responsibilities. The study ponders women's differentiated negotiations with patriarchy which resisted radical challenges when the family and the home framed women's new responsibilities and desires. The rising conservatism rooted in Islam in Turkey, which prioritizes the family over individual women, created the conditions for it.

By developing a relational, spatialized understanding of how young romantic couples justify their transgressive' displays of sexual intimacy in public spaces in contemporary urban Vietnam, this article focuses on how couples, especially women, manage their visibility. This analysis confronts the public civilizational discourse on Vietnamese sexual restraint by analyzing how young couples justify their romantic displays by creating an intimate space within a public environment. This space of visible intimacy is justified through their commitment to marriage. For the individuals involved in these romantic couples, visibility is justified, particularly for young women, through the enjoyment of a newly gained sexual autonomy as they migrate to the city.

Here, it is a rather spatially constricted job search range rather than transport poverty that prevents women living in first-ring suburbs from attaining satisfactory employment. Female commutes are extraordinarily short and most often on foot. While the city now has nearly one million inhabitants and a high car ownership rate, and is located in Europe, the employment and mobility choices and behaviors of its female residents resemble those in developing rather than developed countries, and in small rather than large cities. The reasons underpinning this situation have more to do with socio-cultural gender barriers and less with transport poverty or labor market weaknesses.

Counter-narratives of coping and becoming: Karen refugee women's inside/outside figured worlds	GENDER PLACE AND CULTURE			English	Article						Karen refugee women; Burma; Myanmar; figured world; third space; identity; forced migration; gender	IDENTITY; KNOWLEDGE; ASYLUM; SELF	The purpose of our research is to understand the socially and culturally constructed architecture within which refugee women produce and negotiate identity. This ethnographic case study discusses findings from data collected through participant observation and informal interviews in two refugee camps along the Thai-Burma border. As Karen refugee women described their positionality within and negotiation between the socially constructed Inside and Outside Figured Worlds of the refugee camp, they depict the negotiation of a hybrid Third Space. Created at the intersection of the refugee camp structures that dominate individual agency and the discourses of gender and displacement that influence the social practices of women, this third space is characterized by the response strategies Karen women engage to support individual, family, and community health. Within the transformational spaces that refugee women constructed, the processes of coping and becoming reflected the relationship between structure and agency. Within these intersections a woman could express her resistance to a system that in its design represented a majority she was not a part of. As Karen refugee women moved to redesign their position within these systems, shifts in meaning of cultural norms resulted, inclusive of those that influence or define the role of women.

J	Lagerkvist, A; Andersson, Y				Lagerkvist, Amanda; Andersson, Yvonne			The grand interruption: death online and mediated lifelines of shared vulnerability	FEMINIST MEDIA STUDIES			English	Article						Vulnerability; existential philosophy; affect; digital culture; death	COMMUNICATION	This essay aims to shed light on two online phenomena dominated by women in the contemporary Swedish context-blogs about terminal illness and support groups for the bereaved-and explore what they mean for those afflicted by suffering and loss. We will show that in the shadow of the grand interruption-the moment when the life narrative itself is cut off because of imminent or sudden death-the studied online activities of mourners and the illness stricken, but also and more profoundly, the internet itself, become literal lifelines, both individual and collective. When they assume a salvific vital role this entails both possibilities and predicaments. Studying various renditions of lifeline communication both enables a re-conceptualization of our culture of connectivity as an existential and ambivalent terrain and requires an "upgrading" of the existential to our contemporary technological culture. In forging existential philosophy and the new materialism into a productive, if not tensionless, conversation we stress, firstly, that in emphasizing life and downplaying subjective death some strands of affect theory may neglect the universal absolutes of death and suffering, as sources of fecundity. Ontologically, technologies are lifelines precisely because of severe illness and loss. And secondly, we show that through their practices these women partake in what Karl Jaspers calls a truly "existential elucidation" in both words and deeds, but also importantly through affective encounters online. Their practices display the significance of shared vulnerability in and through the digital. Lifeline communication offers, beyond narrative, the simple promise of being there for one another online, in mutual ethical veneration of both silence and alterity. Hence, attending to grand interruptions allows for appreciating important and heretofore neglected existential implications of mediation, from the horizon of those who in the wake of loss or ill health stand before the abyss, and who live and die with the technology.

Bystander intervention, feminist hashtag activism, and the anti-carceral politics of care	FEMINIST MEDIA STUDIES			English	Article						Bystander intervention; feminism; hashtag activism; transformative justice; Storify	VIOLENCE; WITNESS	The bystander is increasingly being touted as a key agent of change for addressing racialised and gendered violence and street harassment. This essay analyses practices of bystander intervention in Black and indigenous feminist activism against racialised and gendered street harassment that are explicitly anti-carceral and transformative in their approach to achieving justice. I argue that the social media tactics of a transformative justice-informed framework on bystander intervention constitute a particular kind of networked feminist witnessing centred by the experiences of women of colour and a model of justice that challenges police violence and incarceration. Through an analysis of an assemblage of hashtags, Storified narrations of hashtag conversations about bystander intervention, and organised feminist campaigns that centre women of colour perspectives on street harassment and bystander intervention, the social media tactics analysed here model social intervention into racial and gender violence via the transformation of feeling bystanders into media witnesses to gender justice.

J	Dozier, A				Dozier, Ayanna			No happy returns: aesthetics, labor, and affect in Julie Dash's experimental short film, Four Women (1975)	FEMINIST MEDIA STUDIES			English	Article						Experimental film; Black film criticism; affect theory; Black feminism; film aesthetics		Shaped by Black feminist ideology, this essay examines how Black women, as informed by their embodied existence, manipulate film's formal and narrative aesthetics to ask what does cinema do, and what can it do in its portrayal of Black expressive culture. I understand the cinematic (re) presentation of Blackness to be an ideological aesthetic battleground for filmmakers, and while there are a plethora of films and scholarship dedicated to "positive" (re)presentations of Blackness, this is not that study. My study examines how experimental cinema gets around, negates, and dismisses recursively predetermined film portrayals of The Black Experience through its refusal to provide answers. Black women's experimental cinema demonstrates the expressive possibilities of cinema's form through their use of Black expressive culture. In this way, Black women's experimental cinema has always been representative of how cinema generates and conveys affect. To get at this, I will analyze the short experimental film, Four Women (1975) by Julie Dash. Additionally, I turn to Sylvia Wynter's "Re-thinking 'Aesthetics': Notes Towards a Deciphering Practice" to draw out how Four Women's experimental aesthetics counter dominant cinema's relationship with affect through its disinterest in producing "positive" or "happy" affective returns for audience members.

Given their popularity, TV shows are especially powerful in the propagation of images of any form of identity; accordingly, they can be regarded as an interesting and highly effective artistic and socio-cultural vehicle through which representations of old people and of old women in particular can be analysed and discussed. Despite the success of The Golden Girls in the 80s and the exponential ageing of the babyboom generation, TV series have also continued to depict older female characters as either motherly figures, always looking after their families at any cost, or as devilish older women characterised by inappropriate sexualised appearance and sexual behaviour. In contrast to this predominant tendency, Six Feet Under (2001-2005) stands out as a significant exception. In this article, we argue that Six Feet Under is innovative in presenting the older woman through the central character of Ruth Fisher (Francis Connor) and through the interaction of Ruth Fisher with other women within her same generation which face ageing from different perspectives.

J	Smith, S				Smith, Sarah			Posing as art: the ambiguities of feminist body art and the misclassification of Natacha Merritt's pornographic photographs	FEMINIST MEDIA STUDIES			English	Article						Post-feminism; pornography; feminist art; intimate blogs; pornified culture		At the launch of the twenty-first century, the online pornographic photographs of Natacha Merritt, a young American woman (23 years old at the time), were categorised as art in two publications by art publisher Taschen, precipitating a critical acceptance of her work as such. This particular foray of pornography into an art context was briefly contested by one art critic; however, this relatively rare example of misclassification warrants further investigation in order to better understand the role played by what had, by the late twentieth century, become a pervasive post-feminist culture. Drawing on feminist media studies writing that analyses post-feminist modes of "self exploration," and feminist art criticism on the ambiguities of feminist body art, this paper argues that Merritt's "adult-oriented" online digital photographs are more persuasively situated within the increasingly prevalent online genres of the intimate blog and amateur porn. Acknowledging the risk of "collusion" inherent in feminist artworks that focus on the objectified female body, this paper concludes that a compelling critique of a post-feminist (pornified) culture resides in the reactivation of a politics of female sexual pleasure.

I want to especially address the issues of sexual agency and recognition of a positive erotic potential for women living with disabilities. Paradoxically, if mainstream pornography can be a tool of oppression-i.e., the fetishization of differences and the exclusion of the sexual sphere according to racist, homophobic, transphobic, and ableist criteria-it can also be subverted into an emancipation or empowerment tool in order to enlarge the scope of available sexual scripts and of sexual subjectivities.

This hashtag became an important platform for feminist identification and activism against misogyny following its start in 2015 as a way to resist prevailing anti-feminist sentiment in Korea. In addition to opposing stigmas regarding identifying as a feminist, #iamafeminist affords an inclusive frame that can promote feminist identification by sharing personal motives for and stories about being a feminist. Although critics dismiss the potential of hashtag activism due to its ephemeral nature, I argue that #iamafeminist-which I call the "mother tag"- was able to persist for three months by continuing to connect with real-time gender issues and by initiating activism against misogyny both online and offline.

Conceptualizing Chinese female fans as the readers of the transnational text of European football, I conducted in-depth interviews with fifteen self-identified female fans in Shanghai, China. The analysis shows that in their discursive formations of gendered fan authenticity, these women simultaneously reproduce and contest the patriarchal dominance and female stereotypes in European football fandom. As a result, they articulate an ambiguous relation between fan authenticity and themselves as women. Instead of regulating feminine identity to fit into the masculinist fandom, these fans still hold up to the traditional Chinese expectations of femininity in their fan experience.

Women's media leadership	FEMINIST MEDIA STUDIES			English	Article						Relational Leadership; decision makers; media organisations; Ireland	GENDER	This paper presents a small-scale qualitative case study of five women's experiences of leadership roles in Irish media industries. Relational Leadership Theory is used to examine whether there is a gendered dimension to women's leadership and to explore why women's participation in leadership has not resulted in significant feminist gains or changes to media organisations. The article finds that: the women saw their leadership as relational and simultaneously as socially constructed in a gendered manner. Moreover, the women led organisational change towards greater gender equality in the norms of media work. However, while the women's leadership was relational and feminine, it was not necessarily feminist; it did not aim to generate systemic changes within the gendering of the media as an institution. The changes that the women wrought incorporated women into a system of production that remained nonetheless masculinist.

J	de Finney, S				de Finney, Sandrina			Indigenous girls' resilience in settler states: Honouring body and land sovereignty	AGENDA-EMPOWERING WOMEN FOR GENDER EQUITY			English	Article						Indigenous girls; sexualised violence; settler colonial violence; Indigenous resilience and resurgence		In this article I explore colonial violence targeting Indigenous girls in Canada, an active settler state in which the European colonisers "never left" (Tuck and Yang, 2012: 5). In settler states like Canada, sexual violence has been a common practice rooted in colonial logics of the objectification and dehumanisation of Indigenous women and girls. Despite living in one of the world's wealthiest countries with a global reputation for upholding women's rights, Indigenous girls in Canada experience the highest rates of poverty, incarceration, sexual exploitation, and gender violence, and are currently being disappeared and murdered at "epidemic rates" (Anaya, 2013:9). In a context of sustained colonial violence, understanding how Indigenous girls embody dignity and self-determination requires us to reject limited, overly Eurocentric psycho-social notions of resilience. Indigenous analyses instead foreground the systemic political, historical, economic, and sociocultural inequities that structure colonial heteropatriarchy and sexualised violence under settler regimes. Looking beyond a bio-psycho-social model of individual functioning and aptitudes, I document the entanglement of Indigenous girls' body sovereignty and Indigenous self-determination. This conceptual shift takes Indigenous girls' resilience out of its individualised definition and locates it instead in complex kinship networks, across generations, and in relationship with ancestors, lands, and all relations.

J	Singh, S; Myende, T				Singh, Shakila; Myende, Thembeka			Redefining love: Female university students developing resilience to intimate partner violence	AGENDA-EMPOWERING WOMEN FOR GENDER EQUITY			English	Article						love; female university students; intimate partner violence; resilience	WOMAN ABUSE; WOMEN; GENDER; NARRATIVES; YOUTH; PERSPECTIVES; PREVENTION; DISCOURSES; SEXUALITY; CAMPUS	Intimate partner violence (IPV) is a serious global issue that mainly affects women. Power and control are among the driving forces behind IPV, and are endorsed within conservative gender regimes that constitute the social ecologies within which women live and love. Socially constructed ideals of love contribute to women's commitment to forming and remaining in relationships, even if they are abusive. This article draws on data from a study carried out at a selected South African university campus. It highlights evidence of resilience amongst female students through their questioning and redefinition of love in the context of IPV. In this qualitative study, 15 female students were purposefully selected because they live at the campus residences. The main methods of generating data were focus group discussions and individual semi-structured interviews. The findings suggest that young women are alert to love being a gendered discourse that contributes to the prevalence of, and the maintenance of IPV. Specifically, in this study, some of the young women demonstrated resilience by rejecting commonly held disempowering notions of romantic love that many women are invested in, and instead redefined their meanings of love in a less self-sacrificing way.

J	Gordon, SF				Gordon, Sarah Frances			Narratives of resistance and resilience: Exploring stories of violence against women	AGENDA-EMPOWERING WOMEN FOR GENDER EQUITY			English	Article						gender; resilience; resistance; violence against women	PERSPECTIVES	Violence against women is extremely prevalent in South Africa, with one of the highest levels of reported rape world-wide. This article highlights the voices of young women who experienced fear and violation in South Africa, more specifically their acts of resistance in the face of adversity and their process of resilience. The article is based on research which explored how women's lives and identities are transformed by living in violent spaces, such as South Africa. The research adopted a biographical-interpretive methodology and drew on psychosocial and narrative theory, as well as literature surrounding the social-ecological systems approach of resilience and research on resistance. Free-association narrative interviews were conducted with 27 female university students in Cape Town and narrative theory was used to analyse the interview texts. The article draws on the interviews of three of these women. Findings reveal how these women are not just 'victims of patriarchy' but are agentic beings capable of acts of resistance and demonstrating resilience in the face of violence and adversity. Situating the women's narrative responses to the violence within their social ecologies reveals firstly, the importance of women's agentic selves, and secondly, the critical limits on an over-reliance on women's individual strengths and resilience. It is argued that it is neither just nor sustainable to expect women to carry the individual responsibility for sexual violence alone. Instead, the burden rests on society to remedy the high level of incidence of sexual violence with which women live.

Violence renders women vulnerable and in most cases seeks to disempower them. However, most women, once out of the violent situation are able to overcome their adversity. Using Ungar's Social Ecology of Resilience Theory as a framework, this paper demonstrates the journey of women affected by violence to overcome their adversity. It does this through interviews with four women temporarily housed in a "shelter" and three women social workers at the shelter - a non-governmental organisation (NGO). Views, positioning the women's coping strategies in the face of adversity, were solicited from the women and the social workers. The face-to-face interviews through which data was generated was qualitative in nature. Findings show that external resources in the social ecologies of the women, community, state and families, are facilitating resilience in sexually and physically violated women.

J	Wiebesiek, L; Treffry-Goatley, A				Wiebesiek, Lisa; Treffry-Goatley, Astrid			Using participatory visual research to explore resilience with girls and young women in rural South Africa	AGENDA-EMPOWERING WOMEN FOR GENDER EQUITY			English	Article						sexual violence; South Africa; rural; participatory visual research; gender dynamics	YOUTH RESILIENCE; CULTURES; CHILD	Sexual violence is deeply embedded in historical and structural inequalities and is driven by unequal gender power relations. These unequal power relations give rise to gendered norms and practices that inform the social ecologies in which women and girls negotiate their lives. South Africa has one of the highest rates of sexual assault in the world. Research suggests that girls and women from resource-poor rural communities are particularly susceptible to sexual violence due to the dominance of gendered cultural practices and belief systems in these contexts. Our research is part of a six-year, international and interdisciplinary partnership which seeks to explore how participatory visual methods can be used to advance knowledge-production, policy-making and communication in relation to sexual violence against indigenous girls and young women in Canada and South Africa. The data presented in this article are drawn from a series of participatory visual workshops with girls and young women in rural KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. Through a thematic analysis of girl-authored cellphilms and digital stories, and with reference to the seven qualitative aspects related to resilience (Ungar et al., 2007), we explore two questions: (1) How do gendered power dynamics affect resilience in relation to sexual violence in their lives? (2) What is the relationship between resilience and the gendered nature of adversity in this setting? We conclude by suggesting how our work with the girls might support, build and leverage gender-specific resources, which could facilitate resilience in this environment.

It analyses the activities of young women as an organised group, the Girls Against Sexual Violence and Abuse (GASVA), and the ways in which these helped to build their resilience against sexual violence on campus. The profile comes out of a participatory research project conducted at the Durban University of Technology (DUT). It involved a group of 12 female university students and myself as a mentor and 'insider researcher' in addressing sexual and gender-based violence on campus. Established in the latter part of 2015, the group is part of a larger project, the Networks for Change and Well-being, an international interdisciplinary partnership of institutions in Canada and South Africa working to advance 'girlled, from the ground up' interventions aimed at addressing sexual violence against girls and young women. The project uses participatory visual methodologies to provide leadership development and mentoring, as well as to open up spaces for dialogue around sexual violence against women on campus and strategies for addressing them. Through campus dialogues, the use of participatory visual methodologies (photovoice, art, drama and poetry) and social media, GASVA were able to articulate their experiences of sexual violence in and around campus, and to provide a space where others could voice theirs. In these spaces, they identified strategies for addressing sexual violence on campus. After 18 months of participating in the project, GASVA demonstrate leadership capability and resilience and nurture these in their peers as they strive to engage with the campus community in finding solutions to sexual violence in and around campus.

Child marriage, one of the forms of sexual violence is noted to constrain and/or shape girls' current and life-course opportunities and capabilities. The practice remains widespread in Uganda, associated with gender discriminatory social norms, attitudes and practices that make up the social ecology in which adolescent girls live in Uganda. Drawing on a three-year qualitative study on transforming the lives of adolescent girls and young women in Uganda undertaken between 2012 and 2014, the article illuminates the role of social institutions as mediating sites in nurturing girls' resilience to child marriage in Uganda. With reference to the socio-ecological model of resilience, the family was posited as a foundational site for nurturing girls' resilience to discriminatory social norms and practices that sustain child marriage. The school was also noted to be a mediating site that offers support structures and acts as a springboard for positive change. The findings suggest that coordinated actions by multiple actors at the family and school level to effectively address the underlying discriminatory social norms and their manifestations in limiting girls' capabilities have potential to enhance girls' resilience to child marriage and promote girls' empowerment.

J	Flinkfeldt, M				Flinkfeldt, Marie			What Mothers Do: Motherhood as a Resource for Negotiating Sick-Leave Legitimacy in Swedish Sickness Insurance Interactions	NORA-NORDIC JOURNAL OF FEMINIST AND GENDER RESEARCH			English	Article						Motherhood; gender; institutional talk; sickness insurance; sick leave	MEMBERSHIP CATEGORIZATION; NEIGHBOR DISPUTES; GENDER; WOMEN; CHILDREN; PARENTHOOD; EQUALITY; MORALITY; ABSENCE	Sick leave in the Nordic countries is a gendered issue. Alongside other explanations, women's higher levels of sick leave have been linked to their far-reaching family responsibilities. Meanwhile, studies have shown how such responsibilities induce questioning of the legitimacy of sick leave, indicating that normative aspects linking these categories cannot solely be approached in terms of causal explanations. The current study suggests an alternative way of studying this relationship, approaching motherhood as something being "done" in situated ways, to particular ends; a resource for interaction. By analysing naturally occurring interactions-meetings held by the Swedish Social Insurance Agency-the study renders visible the collaborative production of sick leave as a gendered matter, and motherhood as part of the negotiation of sickness insurance. The analysis shows the meaning and import of motherhood for sick leave to be a live issue for participants, drawing attention to how these categories are neither culturally predefined, nor dispositional, but flexibly assembled for certain purposes. Motherhood functions as a resource in two ways: (1) displaying restricted ability to care for children supports claims of impairment; (2) invoking motherhood works to account for slow or inactive rehabilitation. However, occasioning motherhood in the examined context is also risky: (3) displaying extensive mothering may be treated as indicating low commitment to rehabilitation, and (4) displaying limited mothering may be taken as indicating unfitness as a parent.

Firstly, they served as evidence of all the good things that would happen as a result of women gaining the vote, such as wage equality and social reform. Secondly, they played a significant part in establishing a counter-narrative to the anti-suffragist warnings of all the terrible things that would follow women's suffrage. The study also discusses the limitations of political exchange and shows how different political contexts came into play in the debates on the validity of the Norwegian example.

Are Digital Humanities and World Literature establishing themselves as fields utilizing analytical tools that are at odds with the aims and perspectives of feminist literary history and reception history as a part of literary history? We argue that gender research and theory is insufficiently developed in both computational literary history and World Literature. An unproblematic understanding of translations, canonization, English as a global language, and the use of large-scale computational methods and formalized interpretive models is in many cases not beneficial for the understanding of texts by women writers or from feminist perspectives. Drawing on feminist criticism of computational methods and arguments for specialized rather than generalized knowledge about literary history, we propose that digitization in some form, be it a bibliographical database or digitization of a corpus of texts, may be thought of as part of the research process in projects oriented towards gender and cultural exchange.

This contribution is a component of our work for the international Joint Research Project, Travelling TexTs. We concentrate on the presence of Nordic women's writing in various languages in fin de siecle Finland by investigating a library collection from that time. We look at the complexities in the reception of Nordic women's writing in translation in Finland, making use of the concept of the Nordic dimension of translation history, and introducing the notion of intranational reception. We emphasize the role of women translators as cultural transmitters, and the intertwining of national and transnational (or, even, in today's terms, feminist) agendas. We also investigate the reception of Nordic women's texts in the press of that time, by examining both literature written for adults and literature for girls. Working with large-scale digitized sources has enabled us to examine the question of reception broadly.

Research on historical readership groups reveals a strikingly different picture from the one transmitted through literary histories and textbooks. Empirical data from the catalogues of Norwegian reading societies from this period form the basis of the proposed conclusions. From a feminist, scholarly point of view, it is doubly interesting to investigate the fate of female authors among female readers; hence, the main emphasis is on the book collection of the women's reading society based in Oslo from 1874. The collections of other societies, whether male or open to both sexes, are consulted for comparison. Although the material is Norwegian, the results turn out to be comparable to those seen in other countries, not least Finland. The data presented here serve to modify the received canon of European literary history, and to invite future revisions in the reception of female authorship and of women's place in world literature.

J	Campbell-Thomson, O				Campbell-Thomson, Olga			The Soviet Reception of Selma Lagerlof	NORA-NORDIC JOURNAL OF FEMINIST AND GENDER RESEARCH			English	Article						Selma Lagerlof; women writers; literary production; travelling texts; Soviet publishing		The focus of this paper is Selma Lagerlof's literary presence in Soviet Russia. Despite being one of the most translated and published foreign authors in pre-revolutionary times, Lagerlof made very infrequent appearances on the Soviet literary scene for 40-odd years between 1917 and the end of the 1950s. The process of literary production is examined in this paper in search of an explanation for the changing pattern in the publication of Lagerlof's texts. To problematize the process of literary production in the newly established Soviet state, Foucault's conceptualization of the process of knowledge construction is utilized to describe, understand, and explain the interplay between critical resources, such as linguistic and literary expertise, individual initiative, and the government-controlled publishing enterprise in the Soviet state. I argue that the agency of literary workers remained relevant to the literary process, despite increasing ideological pressure on literary production, and that they paved the way towards the official reintroduction of Lagerlof to the Russian Soviet readership during the 1950s.

J	Hassani, S				Hassani, Sara			"Maniacal slaves:" normative misogyny and female resistors of the Mojahedin-e Khalq Iran	INTERNATIONAL FEMINIST JOURNAL OF POLITICS			English	Article						Iran; resistance; violence; feminist thought; critical discourse analysis	WOMEN	Feminist scholars the world over are increasingly aware of the importance of analyzing popular discourse, especially regarding women's involvement in proscribed violence. Yet few have looked at Middle Eastern organizations, and fewer still at the Mojahedin-e Khalq Iran (MEK), a longstanding resistance group whose all-female leadership and sizeable female membership present a compelling challenge to prevailing gender norms. How do popular media portray female MEK resistors and what might these representations signify for our gendered conceptions of violence? In examining the MEK's female leadership, this article undertakes a close reading of western and Iranian news coverage in an attempt to analyze the degree to which these women are painted as willful political agents or, as is often assumed, irrational actors incapable of autonomous political participation. Following Sjoberg and Gentry, I develop four cognitive frames to describe female resistors, while also challenging the media's victimizing and sexualizing gaze. I thus problematize these women's portrayals as "maniacal slaves," and explain how such gendered rhetoric operates to preclude the notion that members of the MEK might practice legitimate political resistance worthy of analysis or understanding.

The concern over the racialized Muslim male body is justifiable in cases of rendition, torture and the kind of battlefields that mark the War on Terror. However, the sympathetic analysis of the tortured Muslim male body as a permanent and universally vulnerable imaginary has necessarily challenged the framing of sexual politics for Muslim contexts. This bid to shield the vulnerable Muslim male body from Islamophobia and imperialist violence forecloses the notion that Islamist patriarchy and politics can themselves be fundamentally violent in the post-9/11 moment and within the Muslim community. This obscures the range of routine, domestic and normative violent expressions observed by men in Muslim societies. This essay discusses two cases that illustrate the means and methods by which female bodies have been sexed by the narrative of the War on Terror in Pakistan. These cases highlight how the academic efforts that seek to rescue the racialized Muslim male body complicate the struggle of resisting (lay) female bodies.

Evidence from this case suggests that: (1) feminist scholars no longer adhere to a one-dimensional prescription of the WPH but are more interested in developing intersectional methods to understand how nonlinear logics of conflict produce and sustain uncoherent gender stereotypes, roles and possibilities of action for women and men; (2) at all levels of analysis (individual, civil society, national) contextual factors, including patterns of political violence, collective identity, class and unequal gender regimes, affect women's political engagement with peace much more than any other factor. Political context and the double gender regime in Israel/Palestine determine specific forms of insecurity experienced by women and are linked to political institutions, social norms and cultural frames that inform choice of action and opportunity for change; and (3) although empirical testing of this hypothesis repeatedly fails to confirm that women are more peaceful than men, the WPH remains a strong conceptual frame that enables women's groups to politically mobilize for change.

I argue that recruitment has little impact on the nature of women's participation within a rebel movement. Drawing on the case of the LTTE in Sri Lanka, I find that the political identities of individual female fighters, shaped by prior experiences of state repression, in particular militarization, can better explain variation in participation than the specific manner of their recruitment. I demonstrate that even in cases of coercive recruitment, female participation cannot be predicted and may even evidence high levels of commitment to the insurgent cause.

Departing from the dominant tendency in studies of paid domestic work to focus on relationships between female employers and workers, the article addresses the role of male domination and patriarchal family structures within employing families in the sexual exploitation of domestic workers by male employers. Using materialist feminist approaches, the article argues that domestic workers' experiences should be seen as embedded in the patriarchal environment created by male household heads who appropriate the labor of other household members, including wives, children and paid domestic workers. The sexual exploitation of domestic workers is then analyzed as being a result of the appropriation of women's entire personhood by men within the relationship of sexage outlined by Colette Guillaumin.

J	Gray, T				Gray, Tricia			Making gender quota mechanics work: a paired comparison of Brazil and Peru	INTERNATIONAL FEMINIST JOURNAL OF POLITICS			English	Article						Electoral gender quotas; women in Latin American politics; representation	WOMENS REPRESENTATION; LATIN-AMERICA; ELECTORAL SYSTEMS; ELECTION; LAWS; CANDIDATES; LESSONS; STEREOTYPES; MAGNITUDE; EQUALITY	Why do similar quotas affect descriptive representation differently and different quotas produce similar results across states? Extant research posits that quota mechanics, which include quota design features and enforcement mechanisms, shape election outcomes. Quota mechanics uses electoral cycles as a common framework with critical junctures for cross-national comparison. A paired comparison of quota mechanics in Brazil and Peru juxtaposes an analysis of their similar 30 percent legislated quotas in sequential election cycles to identify differences that shape their divergent levels of descriptive representation. The findings suggest that quotas can foster critical mass representation in open-list proportional representation systems with the knowledge of quota mechanics. In other words, an understanding of how thresholds, placement mandates and voting procedures shape different stages of the electoral process and of how enforcement is a crucial component for an effective quota. The conclusion summarizes the benefits of the paired-comparison model, in particular for the large number of open-list proportional representation systems worldwide, and future research should further explore the quota mechanics across the world to better understand the process of political representation.

J	Tidy, J				Tidy, Joanna			The operation and subversion of gendered war discourses: soldierhood, motherhood and military dissent in the public production of Kimberly Rivera	INTERNATIONAL FEMINIST JOURNAL OF POLITICS			English	Article						Military dissent; military mothers; soldierhood; subjectivity; anti-war	POLITICAL VIOLENCE; PEACE-MOVEMENT; CONSTRUCTION; FEMINISM; AGENCY; IRAQ	This article undertakes a discourse analysis of texts concerning a recent high profile case of opposition to war by Kimberly Rivera, a US soldier and a mother of five. Developing on previous research concerning how female soldiers, anti-war women and anti-war soldiers have been made intelligible within understandings of war and gender, the analysis traces the discursive repertoires constituting Rivera as a political subject. The article considers how, when and with what implications for broader discourses of gender and war, and their transformation, the categories of soldierhood and motherhood were invoked to construct and obstruct Rivera as an intelligible dissenting subject. The most common presentation of Rivera centered on her motherhood, understood to be in crisis due to her military role. With motherhood and soldierhood seen to be antithetical this crisis could be "solved" through opposition to war. This limited the extent to which Rivera was intelligible as a "thinking citizen" and reproduced motherhood and soldierhood as stable categories leaving their immanent discourses concerning war and gender untroubled. The article then considers ways in which alternative avenues for transformative interventions could open up if dissenters like Rivera were "written" as other than fundamentally contradictory figures.

By examining an NGO that seeks to empower women through writing, I argue that staff members draw upon precarity as a go-to logic to describe the state of Afghan women writers' successes under conditions of insecurity and limited communication. Specifically, it is writers' desires to subvert their social orders and to carve out their own futures that staff members and writing coordinators frame as subject to potential destruction. While recent work has highlighted the importance of recognizing the precarious lifeworlds of vulnerable populations, this article points to the potential implications of a hyper-recognition of precarity - namely, the obscuring of the complexities of individual women's past and present realities. Through analyzing the pedagogies of one empowerment NGO working with women in a post-9/11 Afghanistan, I show how the logic of precarity is concerned with the vulnerability of women's desires and sentiments, rather than their material and political vulnerabilities. It is thus deeply inflected by a historically situated "common sense" about which potentialities and aspirations are inherent to Afghan women.

J	Gilmartin, N				Gilmartin, Niall			"Without women, the war could never have happened": representations of women's military contributions in non-state armed groups	INTERNATIONAL FEMINIST JOURNAL OF POLITICS			English	Article						Female combatants; conflict transition; combatant roles; republican women; commemoration	NORTHERN-IRELAND; GENDER; PARAMILITARIES; NICARAGUA	Feminist international relations theory argues that male consolidation of power in the aftermath of armed conflict often occurs as men gain the status of heroes in the postwar appraisals. Explorations of republican commemoration in the North of Ireland have uncovered the dominance of the male protagonist with a notable relative absence of militant republican women. Militarized masculine narratives and patriarchal understandings of what is deemed a combatant role, and therefore deemed worthy of commemorating, consistently fail to value or recognize women's multiple and vital wartime contributions. This article argues that conventional definitions of military contributions and combatant roles are imprecise, highly gendered and ultimately function as a mechanism to denigrate and exclude women's wartime labor. Based on in-depth interviews with former combatants, the article critically explores the ways in which republican women themselves conceptualize their contributions to armed struggle. Emerging from this is a theoretically rich narrative of women's multiple and diverse military roles which firmly challenge the limited definition of "a person with a weapon." It is suggested that by paying careful attention to the lives of combatant women, feminist scholars can use their experiences, narratives and meanings to challenge existing frameworks and discourses, and redefine combatant roles and wartime contributions.

Gender identities and anti-nuclear activism in peace camps	INTERNATIONAL FEMINIST JOURNAL OF POLITICS			English	Article						Anti-nuclear; peace camps; gender identities; discourse analysis; Faslane Peace Camp	POLITICS	This article investigates the discursive construction of gendered identities in anti-nuclear activism and particularly in peace camps. My starting point is the now substantial academic literature on Cold War women-only peace camps, such as that at Greenham Common. I extend the analysis that emerges from this literature in my research on the mixed-gender, long-standing camp at Faslane naval base in Scotland. I argue that the 1980s saw the articulation in the camp of the figure of the Gender-Equal Peace Activist, displaced in the mid-1990s by Peace Warrior/Earth Goddess identities shaped by radical environmentalism and reinstating hierarchical gender norms. I conclude that gendered identities constructed in and through anti-nuclear activism are even more variable than previously considered; that they shift over time as well as place and are influenced by diverse movements, not solely feminism; and that they gain their political effect not only through the transgression of social norms, but also through discursive linkage with, or disconnection from, political subjectivities in wider society. With such claims, the article aims to re-contextualise Greenham Woman in her particular place and time, and to contribute to a more expansive understanding of the gendering of anti-nuclear activism.

J	Kearns, M				Kearns, Matthew			Gender, visuality and violence: visual securitization and the 2001 war in Afghanistan	INTERNATIONAL FEMINIST JOURNAL OF POLITICS			English	Article						Afghanistan; visual securitization; war on terror; feminist international relations; gender	TERROR; PHOTOGRAPHY; SECURITY; POLITICS; WOMEN; REPRESENTATIONS; CULTURE; ETHICS	Visual securitization (the discursive processes by which images are assigned security implications) is integral to understanding how war and political violence is made possible. However, its insights have yet to be coupled with feminist international relations (IR) scholarship, which is alert to the connections between gender and (in) security. This article synthesizes these two research areas through Lene Hansen's (2011) framework of visual securitization to investigate the gendered logics that underpinned the 2001 war in Afghanistan. By analyzing 123 photojournalistic images alongside American media texts and foreign policy discourse, I argue western images of Afghan women enacted a specific visuality through which they became constructed as a legitimate matter of security. The article makes two important contributions through this analysis. Firstly, it extends feminist understanding of the war in Afghanistan by demonstrating how the interplay between the visual and textual, and the gendered and racial logics operating within such interplay, visually produced Afghan women as a referent object of security. Secondly, this argument illustrates how gender can be critical in enabling the acceptance of visual securitizations, and how such securitizations can be enacted through gendered representations of insecurity and threat.

Engaging Ann Laura Stoler's (2013) language to expose the politics of ruination and preservation, we illustrate the gendered nature of the remaking of life on the most wasted of urban landscapes. The focus of this piece is Kampung Akuarium, a neighborhood violently evicted in April 2016 as part of a broader evictions regime in Jakarta under the governorship of Basuki Tjahaja Purnama, popularly known as Ahok. In the aftermath, Kampung Akuarium became the most restive of Jakarta's landscapes as residents returned to make claims for justice and compensation, and to remake their lives directly on the rubble of their old homes in defiance of the city government. Flanked by the preserved warehouses of the VOC, the ruined neighbourhood ultimately became a site where colonial histories, state-and capital-inflicted expropriation and ruination, and gendered forms of injury and struggle all found material modes of expression alongside one another.

J	Torrey, DJ				Torrey, Deberniere J.			Between heroism and despair: Opportunities and barriers for women in the early Korean Catholic Church	ASIAN JOURNAL OF WOMENS STUDIES			English	Article						Korean Catholicism; Joseon women; patriarchy; guilt; absolution		In nineteenth-century Korea, Catholic ideology and practice countered some of the restrictions imposed on women by the Confucian norms of traditional Korean society. Thus, many Catholic women acted with greater agency than was typical outside the Church. Yet instances of self-determined activity among Catholic women, such as choosing the vocation of celibacy, seemingly decreased further in the nineteenth century as the Church became more established. Some scholars argue that the reason for this apparent decrease connects to patriarchal or critical views of women in the Catholic teaching of the time, while others argue that the circumstances of persecution compelled the clergy to restrict the activities of women for the sake of avoiding the unwanted attention of non-Catholics. This paper revisits the discussion of this apparent shift by examining the cases of three Catholic women to illuminate additional nuances. It argues that the contrasting reasons given for this decrease in agency could easily be mutually reinforcing, and that evidence suggests an additional reason: concern about soul salvation.

J	Ermis-Mert, A				Ermis-Mert, Asli			Gendered jobs and occupational prestige in Turkey: Women in the hierarchy elevator	ASIAN JOURNAL OF WOMENS STUDIES			English	Article						Female employment; gender segregation at work; occupational prestige; maternal employment; women in higher education; horizontal gender segregation		The success of women in traditionally male disciplines of higher education is not correspondingly reflected in their employment in high-prestige male-dominated jobs in Turkey and this paper seeks to understand the individual level factors that have influenced women's limited presence in these, particularly in relation to their household-and family-related responsibilities from the 1980s to the 2000s and with reference to current patterns. The term "hierarchy elevator" is introduced to describe and elaborate how horizontal gender segregation intersects with vertical gender segregation as both create disadvantages for women in the job market, considering that their representation is limited in traditionally male jobs and prestigious jobs. Using ordered logistic regressions, this paper demonstrates that being highly educated reinforces women's career trajectories in high-prestige male-dominated jobs in Turkey, while married women are largely excluded from these. Those who have one child compared to none are more likely to attain these jobs, while having two or more children impedes their labor market outcomes in these positions. This finding can be associated with the expanded financial resources of the few women who work in high-prestige male-dominated jobs for being able to afford childcare, and who may also prefer to have just one child each in order to maintain their status in these demanding jobs.

J	Lokuge, G; Hilhorst, D				Lokuge, Gayathri; Hilhorst, Dorothea			Outside the net: Intersectionality and inequality in the fisheries of Trincomalee, Sri Lanka	ASIAN JOURNAL OF WOMENS STUDIES			English	Article						Women in fisheries; intersectionality; Sri Lanka; conflict; livelihoods	PERSPECTIVE; ETHNICITY; GENDER	Inequality and conflict in Sri Lanka have frequently been analyzed along ethnic lines. However, many scholars have stressed the importance of other dimensions of identity, such as gender, caste and class, in studying social tension. This study uses intersectionality theory to examine how a combination of the social categories of gender, race, ethnicity and location creates structural inequality. This article draws upon in-depth research on Muslim, Tamil, Sinhalese and indigenous/Veder women who catch and market fish in the conflict-affected eastern district of Trincomalee, Sri Lanka. The focus was on intra-group differences among these women and the different sources of power they use to subvert existing power structures. Although multiple inequalities affected the respondents' daily lives and participation in activities, they were not passive victims; they used their own agency to negotiate for their livelihoods. Nevertheless, the women who comprise the focus of this study appeared to be completely invisible to government fisheries management bodies. The lack of institutional representation has disadvantaged them in their negotiations for space to engage in livelihood activities. Registration of these women by the government department of fisheries among those who make a living from fishing would provide them with a first measure of recognition and empowerment, strengthening their chances of negotiating access to the fishery livelihood resources.

J	Dhawan, NB				Dhawan, Nandita Banerjee			From 'fire-brand' to 'water-brand': The caste politics of Uma Bharati	ASIAN JOURNAL OF WOMENS STUDIES			English	Article						Women leaders; political movements; Hindutva; caste; sanyasin (ascetic woman); nationalist politics		This paper uses a case study of Uma Bharati, a woman political leader, to argue that despite appropriating multiple-axis thinking to mask casteism inherent in their ideology, Hindutva politics essentially lays bare its brahmanical allegiance and lineage, with its larger agenda to redefine India as a Hindu rashtra or nation. Bharati, a 'fiery sanyasin' (female ascetic) of Other Backward Classes (OBC) background, had been awarded a portfolio to clean the 'polluted' Ganga river in the Narendra Modi cabinet in 2014. This paper points out the significance of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in granting this responsibility to a 'radical' who had strategically deployed her caste identity to gain power in Hindutva politics. Bharati had gone against the party to demand caste-based quotas in women's reservation in parliament, and succeeded in rupturing the monolithic identity of upper-caste womanhood in the BJP. While this resulted in the patriarchal upper-caste leadership of the party expelling the 'indisciplined' Bharati on more than one occasion, they have not been able to ignore her. Instead they have 'domesticated' the politically ambitious lower-caste Bharati by conferring her with ministerial power, and compelling her to change focus from the controversial issue of caste to that of cleaning the Ganga, which is a symbol of national and Hindu religious interest.

By adopting a bottom-up empowerment approach, F institution (a pseudonym) combined practical and strategic gender needs. Since the former admit differences among female migrants, it incorporates family and children among the target groups of its services. Meanwhile, the latter imply commonality among female migrants, leading them to break out of the family, which is always regarded as a private sphere, and finally to resist the oppression and stigmas arising out of the social, cultural and political system, using the power of alliance. At an operational level, the organization adopted dialogue and praxis as its major action strategy. This article will discuss how and why it is important to promote the establishment of a collective group of female migrants.

Drawing on feminist disability theory and recent discussions of debility, I argue that neoliberalism and its austerity practices are evident in recent Canadian policies. In particular, feminist analysis of fitting/misfitting, debility, and capacity help us to understand the particular impacts on women with disabilities of these policy changes. In addition, building on Wendy Brown's (2016) concept of sacrificial citizenship under neoliberalism, I illustrate the pervasive neoliberal tendencies at work in ongoing Canadian discussions of physician-assisted dying. These challenge and extend our understandings of the interplay between gender and disability in austere times.

Utilizing original interviews with civil society delegates in the United States and Canada, government documents and media and academic accounts, we challenge prevailing interpretations of the WCAR to show that it was an important space for expressions of an explicit feminist intersectionality approach, especially the intersection of racism with gender. Our findings demonstrate how intersectionality was relevant to the discussions of both state and civil society delegates and served to highlight racialized, gendered, and other discriminatory patterns. Based on this evidence, we argue that the WCAR process played a significant role in advancing a global conversation about intersectionality and therefore carried potential for advancing an anti-racist agenda for the twenty-first century. That this is not widely understood or highlighted has to do with challenges to the WCAR, particularly the withdrawal of key states from the process and a negative discourse concerning discussions and scholarly analysis of the WCAR process. We suggest that acknowledging the presence of intersectionality in the WCAR process gestures towards a more accurate historical record. It also suggests both the opportunities and constraints afforded by intersectional analysis in moments of transition and mainstreaming. As such, the "Durban moment," and the WCAR more broadly, are highly relevant for the study of women, politics, and human rights over the first decade of the twenty-first century.

J	Carlsson, H				Carlsson, Hanna			Researching boxing bodies in Scotland: Using apprenticeship to study the embodied construction of gender in hyper masculine space	GENDER PLACE AND CULTURE			English	Article						Apprenticeship method; embodiment; gender; boxing; women boxers		This article presents apprenticeship as an ethnographic method suitable for researching topics concerning gender and space. To use this method, the researcher takes up a practice, such as a sport. Emphasis lies in understanding one's topic by body', and the article argues that such an embodied perspective sheds a new light on gender construction in the boxing gym. An empirical study of female amateur boxers in Scotland, conducted by the author, herself a competitive female boxer, reinforces the argument. The position of an embodied insider offers the researcher a unique vantage point with regard to various contrasting processes of gender construction on different scales, such as the body, embodied encounters and the gym. By giving attention to the transformative power of bodily practice, apprenticeship focuses on possibilities for, resistance to, and transformation of, gender norms in hyper masculine spaces. The apprenticeship method can therefore enrich geography's understanding of the role of physical practices for gender construction in different spaces.

J	Mott, C; Cockayne, D				Mott, Carrie; Cockayne, Daniel			Citation matters: mobilizing the politics of citation toward a practice of 'conscientious engagement'	GENDER PLACE AND CULTURE			English	Article						Anti-racist geography; citation; feminist geography; performativity; reflexivity; academia	HUMAN-GEOGRAPHY; ANGLO-AMERICAN; WOMEN; POWER; GENDER; RACE; GLOBALIZATION; DIFFERENCE; TRADITIONS; UNIVERSITY	An increasing amount of scholarship in critical, feminist, and anti-racist geographies has recently focused self-reflexively on the topics of exclusion and discrimination within the discipline itself. In this article we contribute to this literature by considering citation as a problematic technology that contributes to the reproduction of the white heteromasculinity of geographical thought and scholarship, despite advances toward more inclusivity in the discipline in recent decades. Yet we also suggest, against citation counting and other related neoliberal technologies that imprecisely approximate measures of impact, influence, and academic excellence, citation thought conscientiously can also be a feminist and anti-racist technology of resistance that demonstrates engagement with those authors and voices we want to carry forward. We argue for a conscientious engagement with the politics of citation as a geographical practice that is mindful of how citational practices can be a tool for either the reification of, or resistance to, unethical hierarchies of knowledge production. We offer practical and conceptual reasons for carefully thinking through the role of citation as a performative embodiment of the reproduction of geographical thought.

We build on these insights to explore how associations between masculinities, technology and entrepreneurship shape ideas and practices of small-scale water provision in Maputo. Our findings show how activities (i.e. technical craftsmanship, hard physical work) or abilities (i.e. risk-taking, innovativeness) regarded as masculine tend to be considered the defining features of the profession. This shapes how men and women make sense of and talk about their work, each of them tactically emphasizing and performing those aspects best fitting their gender. Our detailed documentation of men's and women's everyday involvements in water provisioning challenges the existence of sharp boundaries and distinctions between genders and professional responsibilities. It shows that water provisioning requires many other types of work and skills and male and female household members collaborate and share their work. The strong normative-cultural associations between gender and water provisioning lead to a distinct under-recognition of women's importance as water providers. We conclude that strategies to effectively support small-scale water businesses while creating more space and power for women involved in the business require the explicit recognition and re-conceptualization of water provisioning as a household business.

J	Alzeer, G				Alzeer, Gergana			Cocoons as a space of their own: a case of Emirati women learners	GENDER PLACE AND CULTURE			English	Article						Space; gender; culture; Emirati women; Lefebvre; higher education; spatiality	EDUCATION	This article focuses on cocooning' as a spatial practice of Emirati higher education women learners in a single-sex learning context, which emerged from exploring the intersectional and intertwined relationship of gender, place and culture with its unique cultural formation that informs women learners' spatiality. To understand women's spatiality and explore these intersecting relations, I conducted an ethnographic qualitative inquiry, applying multiple levels of data gathering and analysis. I also utilised social theories of space as a theoretical framework, specifically the social construction of space and Lefebvre's triad of perceived, conceived and lived space. Cocooning, represented in these women learners' unique spatial appropriation in their quest for a space of their own, emerged as a pervasive socially constructed spatial theme. As a spatial practice, it was largely influenced by the women learners' cultural model, including socio-cultural status and gender roles, rooted in their national, historical colonial and traditional past as well as current economic, political, demographic, academic-institutional and global positions and demands. Furthermore, cocooning is a spatial representation of what also seems a universal longing among women, beyond context and culture, for a space of one's own. Such a spatial need is manifested differently in the perceived space while shared in the conceived and lived.

Thus focusing on the gendering of happiness' and the discrepancies between ideals and practices, the article unfolds how intersections between a number of power-geometries' including violence preventive legislation, an official family discourse, and the patrilineally organized family facilitate the conditions that allow for male-to-female violence in the domestic sphere. The article highlights how Intimate Partner Violence transmutes the happy family' into a zone of exception' wherein which the laws prohibiting violence are suspended, the juridico-political status and rights of a woman blurred, and a state of chronic precariousness and crisis generated. Such tendencies are fortified by the ambiguous strategies of the Women's Union. In maneuvering between violence preventive legislation and family ideals, the Union is criticizing patriarchal family hierarchies while also encouraging women to nurture family happiness by complying with an abusive partner.

J	Wattis, L				Wattis, Louise			Exploring gender and fear retrospectively: stories of women's fear during the "Yorkshire Ripper' murders	GENDER PLACE AND CULTURE			English	Article						Serial murder; gender; women's fear of crime; violence against women; narrative	SOCIAL-CONTROL; CRIME; VIOLENCE	The murder of 13 women in the North of England between 1975 and 1979 by Peter Sutcliffe who became known as the Yorkshire Ripper can be viewed as a significant criminal event due to the level of fear generated and the impact on local communities more generally. Drawing upon oral history interviews carried out with individuals living in Leeds at the time of the murders, this article explores women's accounts of their fears from the time. This offers the opportunity to explore the gender/fear nexus from the unique perspective of a clearly defined object of fear situated within a specific spatial and historical setting. Findings revealed a range of anticipated fear-related emotions and practices which confirm popular high-fear' motifs; however, narrative analysis of interviews also highlighted more nuanced articulations of resistance and fearlessness based upon class, place and biographies of violence, as well as the way in which women drew upon fear/fearlessness in their overall construction of self. It is argued that using narrative approaches is a valuable means of uncovering the complexity of fear of crime and more specifically provides renewed insight onto women's fear.

To promote the site, the organizer, Couchsurfing.org, creates the discourse of Couchsurfing cosmopolitanism to emphasize the value of sharing with strangers and tolerance of cultural difference in Couchsurfing practice. This study argues that the discourse production is under a patriarchal system, in which the experience about women's fear of men's harassment and according practice are concealed. By conceptualizing the sexed-and-gendered body in Couchsurfing, this study exposes the power, knowledge and social relation in the cross-cultural context of Couchsurfing, represented not only in women's feeling, performance and interaction but also in their embodied cosmopolitanism. The comparison between with Western-European and East-Asian women's experience is also included in the analysis. It highlights the effects of the gender role inscribed on women's body which makes a difference in women's cross-cultural interaction as well as their embodied cosmopolitanism.

J	Greenburg, J				Greenburg, Jennifer			New military femininities: humanitarian violence and the gendered work of war among US servicewomen	GENDER PLACE AND CULTURE			English	Article						Military; gender; United States; counterinsurgency; femininity; violence	FEMINIST GEOPOLITICS; 3RD GENDER; (IN)SECURITY; AFGHANISTAN; GEOGRAPHIES; BODIES	This article examines military femininity' in new gendered forms of labor employed by the U.S. military in the post-September 11 wars. Between 2003 and 2013, when women were technically banned from direct assignment to ground combat units, the U.S. military deployed all-female counterinsurgent teams in Iraq and Afghanistan. In various forms, these teams searched Iraqi women at checkpoints and in home raids, provided medical assistance to Afghan women and children, and participated in highly combative special operations missions alongside Army Rangers and Green Berets in Afghanistan. Recent literature on the gendering of counterinsurgency in Iraq and Afghanistan focuses mainly on the teams' deployment of humanitarianism and affect as weapons of war, while older feminist critiques analyze women's marginalization within military institutions. This article reconceptualizes military femininity, departing from the prevailing marginalization and humanitarian frameworks. Drawing on military and policy documents, first-hand observations of military trainings, and interviews with military trainers, I show how women were integrated into ground combat through the promotion of certain gender essentialisms, such as feminine domesticity, alongside military violence. A new form of military femininity has emerged that eschews humanitarian rhetoric, and instead emphasizes servicewomen's lethality.

For most of its history, the factory was home to thousands of workers, many of who were women and, at times, outnumbered men two to one. While the site is now known for the university that it houses, photographs and archival records from the early twentieth century reveal the centrality of women in the process and production of tobacco and cigarettes until the factory completely shut down in 1995. Using oral history methods, we recorded the memories of 17 women who worked in the factory. A multi-faceted analysis reveals the gendered nature of the space at the time as well as the importance of the factory as a place in the lives of these women.

Our aim is to explore the process of women becoming mothers' through journeying on-foot somewhere with children in car-dependent cities. To do so we utilise empirical material gathered as part of a walking sensory ethnography with families living in Wollongong, New South Wales, Australia. Drawing on Deleuze and Guattari's assemblage thinking and a feminist care ethics we argue that entanglements with bodies and materials alongside ideas, emotions and affects shape how motherhood becomes and is felt on-the-move through moments of care'. We discuss five moments where care emerges not just as a gendered practice, but as an affective force and embodiment of motherhood; these include: preparedness, togetherness, playfulness, watchfulness, and attentiveness. Instead of assuming the figure of the mother is a given identity; insights are provided into how the dilemmas of becoming a good' mobile mother are felt through moments of care.

Focusing on their motivations, anxieties and practices, we situate our analysis with respect to discussions of intensive mothering, transnational motherhood and multi-layered meanings of citizenship. We suggest that the motivations women have for traveling to and staying in the U.S. in the later stages of their pregnancy reveal a new terrain of intensive mothering, tied to locally specific perceptions of future unpredictability and restrictions on individual choice. This particular discourse of intensive mothering involves the promotion of individualistic-decision-making and individualized efforts to control macro-processes, and reveals how citizenship acquisition for the children reproduces and disguises inequalities at the transnational level. Yet, this is also an intensely emotional process, not only indicative of the pressures on mothers, but also women's multilayered conflicts of belonging and identity across spaces and scales of citizenship.

Here's looking at her: an intersectional analysis of women, power and feminism in film	JOURNAL OF GENDER STUDIES			English	Article						Feminism; women; film; power; intersectionality		While feminist film scholars have considered what makes a film feminist, we explore this question from a feminist sociological perspective with an emphasis on power and women in film. We take an intersectional approach to explore gender, race, ethnicity and social class in films about women. We draw from Amy Allen's conception of power as the interrelated triad of domination (power-over), empowerment/resistance (power-to), and solidarity (power-with). We then apply Sutherland's elaboration on those forms of power in terms of how they are depicted in film. Results reveal that most feminist films revolve around stories about power-to; women finding the courage to individually confront and challenge existing norms. Power-to films are predominantly tales of white, middle class women. Women of color are most likely to be featured in power-over films. Very few can be considered power-with films that demonstrate solidarity among women. We conclude that more women and men with feminist values behind the camera is a necessary, but not sufficient, requirement to change cultural representations of women and power in film.

Gender models: changing representations and intersecting roles in Dutch and Italian fashion magazines, 1982-2011	JOURNAL OF GENDER STUDIES			English	Article						Gender representation; fashion magazines; intersectionality; Goffman; Italy; Netherlands	ADVERTISEMENTS; IMAGES; WOMENS; MASCULINITY; CONSUMPTION; FEMINISM; BEAUTY	This article presents a comparative content analysis of gender representation in fashion magazines in Italy and the Netherlands. Updating Goffman's classic study of Gender Advertisements, we study the intersections of gender, professional role, country and time in media representation. Thus, we combine and confront quantitative content analysis with insights from critical gender studies on polysemy and intersectionality. Analyzing a sample of 5840 images from mainstream, commercial and high fashion magazines published in 1982, 1996 and 2011, we find that gender representation strongly intersects with time, place, and notably: professional role. Models, who represent the specific aesthetic capital' of the fashion field, are portrayed in highly specific ways. Over time, gender differences in representation become stronger in Italy, while in the Netherlands male and female representation converges towards conventionally feminine' styles. In both countries, we find increasing prominence of (North-American) Goffmanian gender conventions and a new withdrawn' gendered style emerging in the early 2000s. This new style employs new signs and conventions to denote gender and professional status: it separates men from women, and models from non-models. Our analysis shows, first, that gender representation does not directly reflect gender inequality. Second, it demonstrates the impact of globalization on gender representation. Third, it highlights the polysemy and cultural specificity of visual signs: gender difference can be ritualized' and stylized' in various ways. These diverse gendered conventions intersect with other characteristics, and may convey diverse, and changing messages about the relation between gender and sexuality, power, aesthetics and (visual) pleasure.

The background for the analysis is the recent rise in demand for sperm from combat soldiers during the war between Israel and Hamas. The data-set for the project is comprised of multiple sources which converge to provide evidence for the transfusion of Zionist ideology into sperm donation. The article suggests the compatibility of the venerated status gained by donors who are Israeli Defense Force combatants with Zionist militarism. The banks screen candidates for sperm donation based on their military service and military health profile. The discursive climate which glorifies warriors' permeates sperm marketing, contributing to the cultural reproduction of a militaristic ideology. The article concludes by contending that sperm banks provide a platform for a subversive discourse that triggers Enloe's thesis of patriotic motherhood and the role of women in the process of militarization.

JOURNAL OF GENDER STUDIES			English	Article						Sexual violence; gender crimes; gender justice; international criminal law; International Criminal Court	HUMAN SECURITY; GENDER JUSTICE; LAW; RAPE; WOMEN; RETHINKING; PATRIARCHY; CONFLICT; SOLDIERS; NEWNESS	Despite the spectacular development in the field of international criminal law, critical feminism stresses the narrow scope of the sex and gender crimes in the Rome Statute establishing the first permanent International Criminal Court. The current international criminal law discourse, as expressed by recent case law, is geared towards the protection of certain groups targeted on account of their distinctiveness within the framework of a conflict situation, and gender is not recognized as one of these group identities. The question whether international criminal law on sexual violence applies only to inter-group conflicts brings to the fore an uneasy likelihood of exclusion of some recently emergent situations where identities of the conflicting parties transcend a particular ethnicity or nationality, and where victims of sexual violence belong to the same group as their perpetrators. The article argues that, rather than the Rome Statute or newly introduced rules and regulations, a significant obstacle in developing gender justice is the narrow interpretation of sexual violence to inter-group hostilities.

J	Lovelock, M				Lovelock, Michael			Call me Caitlyn: making and making over the "authentic' transgender body in Anglo-American popular culture	JOURNAL OF GENDER STUDIES			English	Article						Transgender; celebrity culture; body culture; makeover; identity; Caitlyn Jenner	GENDER; FEMININITY; MAKEOVER; IDENTITY	A conception of transgender identity as an authentic' gendered core trapped' within a mismatched corporeality, and made tangible through corporeal transformations, has attained unprecedented legibility in contemporary Anglo-American media. Whilst pop-cultural articulations of this discourse have received some scholarly attention, the question of why this wrong body' paradigm has solidified as the normative explanation for gender transition within the popular media remains underexplored. This paper argues that this discourse has attained cultural pre-eminence through its convergence with a broader media and commercial zeitgeist, in which corporeal alteration and maintenance are perceived as means of accessing one's authentic' self. I analyse the media representations of two transgender celebrities: Caitlyn Jenner and Nadia Almada, alongside the reality TV show TRANSform Me, exploring how these women's gender transitions have been discursively aligned with a cultural imperative for all women, cisgender or trans, to display their authentic femininity through bodily work. This demonstrates how established tropes of authenticity-via-bodily transformation, have enabled transgender to become culturally legible through the wrong body trope. Problematically, I argue, this process has worked to demarcate ideals of acceptable' transgender subjectivity: self-sufficient, normatively feminine, and eager to embrace the possibilities for happiness and social integration provided by the commercial domain.

This study challenges the prevailing argument that these perceptions fundamentally changed from lusty whores' to victims of poverty. An examination of Bridewell records, sermons, pamphlets, and the newspaper press, reveals that commentators believed that lust, poverty, and greed collectively explained what drove women to prostitution. Commentators recognized that, unable to make ends meet, many women turned to prostitution to survive, while also suggesting that others turned to prostitution because they believed they could gain considerable wealth by doing so. These same commentators asserted that some women were unusually lustful and that only prostitution would satisfy their insatiable desires. The simultaneous depiction of prostitutes in contradictory ways suggests that prostitution was not offensive to Georgian Britons solely because it involved women exchanging sexual favours for money, but because prostitution transgressed Britons' deepest sensibilities about morality.

J	Chadwick, R				Chadwick, Rachelle			Thinking intersectionally with/through narrative methodologies	AGENDA-EMPOWERING WOMEN FOR GENDER EQUITY			English	Article						narrative; intersectionality; voice; dialogical; qualitative	TRANSNATIONAL FEMINISM; ACCOUNTS; STORY; WOMEN	This article explores the potentially productive relations and tensions between narrative methodologies and intersectional research. The following questions are explored: How might narrative approaches be productive tools for intersectional research? How does intersectionality challenge and potentially extend current modes of narrative inquiry? What are the tensions of thinking intersectionality with/through narrative and vice versa? While a substantial (and contested) literature exists on intersectionality, particularly in feminist theory, there is currently a lack of clarity about how to 'do' intersectionality at the level of research practice and methodology. Several conceptual frameworks have been developed, including those by Crenshaw (1991), McCall (2005) and Prins (2006), but their methodological implications remain vague. Furthermore, although narrative has previously been put forward as a method of analysis particularly well suited to intersectional research (Phoenix and Pattynama, 2006; Ludvig, 2006; Cole, 2009), the rationale and implications of this merger have not been well developed. This article explores the entanglements (Barad, 2007) produced by putting narrative inquiry and intersectional approaches in conversation with one another. It argues that narrative approaches potentially offer rich methodological tools for intersectional analyses, particularly in relation to their ability to grant epistemic privilege to marginalised voices (Mohanty, 2013) and trace the multiple and contradictory stories and experiences of research participants and their emphasis (in some variants) on the ethics of listening (Gilligan et al, 2003). Intersectional approaches also challenge and extend narrative methodologies in fruitful directions. In particular, intersectional thinking shows the limitations of focusing only on individual experience and textual story-telling, and highlights the methodological importance of finding ways to explore and analyse the material, structural and political realities that co-construct lives/narratives.

This reintroduced discussions of the concept of intersectionality into public debate and academic scholarship. Intersectionality refers to the interlocking relations of dominance of multiple social, political, cultural and economic dynamics of power that are determined simultaneously by identity categories of race, gender, class, sexuality, disability and others. The aims of this focus piece are firstly to do a conceptual analysis of the concept of intersectionality, secondly to look at critiques of intersectionality, and thirdly to contextualise it for South Africa by illustrating it with student protests in a post-colonial context.

J	Mahali, A				Mahali, Alude			'Without community, there is no liberation': on #BlackGirlMagic and the rise of Black woman-centred collectives in South Africa	AGENDA-EMPOWERING WOMEN FOR GENDER EQUITY			English	Article						#BlackGirlMagic; Black Consciousness; recognition; justice; black women collectives	CONSCIOUSNESS; GENDER; FEMINISM; THEATER	There is increasing global desire by and from black women to connect with other black women for identification, promotion of wellbeing, protection and love demonstrated by the hashtag movement: #BlackGirlMagic. In South Africa this movement has manifested through the rise of black woman-centred collectives who bring newfound power and urgency to contemporary black feminisms. These collectives are crafting unapologetic spaces centred on the lives and lived experience of black women; part of this experience is encouraging radical self-love and care as a community-building exercise. Self-love and the enrichment of other black women has become an important part of the contemporary revolutionary imagination; thus this article adopts Nancy Fraser's strategy of seeing identity politics' as a politics of recognition and justice. Seeing identity politics as a politics of recognition and justice becomes a helpful way of rethinking democratic politics in a socially unequal society. Already in the late 1960s, emerging from the Black Consciousness Movement, Steve Biko defined Black Consciousness as an inward-looking process that rejects whiteness and seeks to instil in the black community self-determination and pride. Using the hashtag movement #BlackGirlMagic and collectives like For Black Girls Only, the iQhiya collective and the Feminist Stokvel, this article asks how recognition and identification can promote justice and self-determination. Justice here is understood in the way Fraser unpacks social justice, as requiring both recognition and redistribution. The article also illuminates how these black woman collectives operate in conversation with Audre Lorde, whose early writings on black radical thought and black women organising work as a kind of antecedent to what these burgeoning collectives are doing. In a world that seeks to devalue the myriad contributions of black women, this article is necessary documentation and testimony of the self-affirming and revolutionary work that young black women are doing for and by themselves in their own spaces, the world over. I argue that the deliberate act of adopting a politics of recognition' - where race, class and gender intersect - is a necessary step towards justice.

J	Prah, E				Prah, Efua			Stratifications of blackness: Meditations on the intersect of gender, race and age	AGENDA-EMPOWERING WOMEN FOR GENDER EQUITY			English	Article						intersectionality; critical race theory; gender; racism; blackness		This paper seeks to address the current silences enmeshed in an articulation of blackness in higher education institutions. Using intersectionality as a theoretical framework I unpack the larger hegemonic structures that produce pockets of freedom and access for a select few that I, in many instances, am denied because of my age, gender and race. I am grappling with an experience in which the very idea of my capabilities as an academic are challenged by a triple reflection that I constantly have to negotiate. It is increasingly becoming clear that it is not possible to ignore a presentation of identity that is absent of my ontological positionality as a young black female academic. Each identity that colours my field is fully loaded with its overlapping meanings that wrestle for front stage in an arena that presupposes my subordination even before I enter the space. My field of reason is measured by the sets of performative identities that I have inherited from centuries of interlocked suppressive systems that have been imposed on me, and that have figured and continue to figure me as a secondary and subordinate image. These inheritances largely still remain as powerful representations of an architecture of oppression. This perspective is a meditation on how as a young black female academic I must redesign the misshapen hedge that sets borders to my imagined horizons of being. In academic writing the intersection of race and gender has been widely covered; however, the category of age has received less attention - so this paper sets to task the inclusion of age as a critical area where discrimination happens. Certainly for southern African writers the intersect of age, race and gender remains subjectively unaccounted for and the reflections presented here seek to make meaning of deceptive perceptions that arrive couched as well-meaning liberal hand-outs. I question my own subjective figuration of what it means to be young, to be black and to be a woman in an overwhelmingly ageing white male-oriented field.

J	Dworzanowski-Venter, B				Dworzanowski-Venter, Bronwyn			An intersectional analysis of male caregiving in South African palliative care: Identifying disruptive potential in reinventions of white, hegemonic masculinity	AGENDA-EMPOWERING WOMEN FOR GENDER EQUITY			English	Article						masculinity; care; emotional labour; respectability; gender norms	SOCIAL REPRODUCTION; RACE	Care work is often feminised and invisible. Intangible components of care, such as emotional labour, are rarely recognised as economically valuable. Men engaging in care work can be stigmatised or simply made invisible for non-conformance to gender norms (Dworzanowski-Venter, 2008). Mburu et al (2014) and Chikovore et al (2016) have studied masculinity from an intersectional perspective, but male caregiving has not enjoyed sufficient intersectional focus. Intersectional analysis of male caregiving has the twin benefits of making women's work' visible and finding ways to keep men involved in caring occupations. I foreground the class-gender intersection in this study of black male caregivers as emotional labourers involved in palliative care work in Gauteng (2005-2013). Informal AIDS care and specialist oncology nursing are contrasting cases of male care work presented in this article. Findings suggest that caregiving men interviewed for this study act in gender-disruptive ways and face a stigmatising social backlash in post-colonial South Africa. Oncology nursing has a professional cachet denied to informal sector caregivers. This professional status acts as a class-based insulator against oppressive gender-based stigma, for oncology nursing more closely aligns to an idealised masculinity. The closer to a respectable' middle-class identity, or bourgeois civility, the better for these men, who idealise traditionally white male formal sector occupations. However, this insulating effect relies on a denial of emotional aspects of care by male cancer nurses and a lack of activism around breaking down gendered notions of care work. Forming a guild of informal sector AIDs caregivers could add much-needed professional recognition and provide an organisational base for gender norm disruption through activism. This may help to retain more men in informal sector caregiving roles and challenge the norms that are used to stigmatise male caregiving work in general.

J	Walker, R; Vearey, J; Nencel, L				Walker, Rebecca; Vearey, Jo; Nencel, Lorraine			Negotiating the city: Exploring the intersecting vulnerabilities of non-national migrant mothers who sell sex in Johannesburg, South Africa	AGENDA-EMPOWERING WOMEN FOR GENDER EQUITY			English	Article						sex work; mothers; migration; South Africa; intersectionality; entanglements	CAPE-TOWN; WORKERS; MIGRATION; WOMEN; CONTEXT; HEALTH	This article explores the intersecting vulnerabilities of non-national migrant mothers who sell sex in Johannesburg, South Africa - one of the most unequal cities in the world. Migrants who struggle to access the benefits of the city live and work in precarious peripheral spaces where they experience intersecting vulnerabilities associated with gender norms, race, and nationality. These vulnerabilities manifest as abuse, discrimination, criminalisation, and multiple levels of structural and direct violence. Migrant women who sell sex also face stigma and moralising associated with the illegal sale of sex, being foreign, and being a single parent. Drawing on ethnographic work with non-national migrant mothers who sell sex in Johannesburg, and from ongoing work exploring research, policy and programmatic responses to migration, sex work and health, we use an analytical lens of intersectionality to explore the daily challenges associated with encountering and negotiating intersecting vulnerabilities. We consider how these vulnerabilities form entanglements (drawing on Munoz, 2016) and are (re)produced and embodied in everyday practice in the city. We explore how they shift in significance and impact depending on context and social location, and argue for a nuanced approach to understanding migration and the sale of sex that recognises these intersecting vulnerabilities - and entanglements.

J	Moore, E; Himonga, C				Moore, Elena; Himonga, Chuma			Centring the intersection of race, class, and gender when a customary marriage ends: An intersectional critique of the Recognition of Customary Marriages Act of 1998	AGENDA-EMPOWERING WOMEN FOR GENDER EQUITY			English	Article						Intersectionality; Customary Marriage; Recognition of Customary Marriage Act; rural women		Based on an empirical study of marital dissolution, this article explores the race, class, and gender dimensions of the Recognition of Customary Marriages Act (120 of 1998) (RCMA). Drawing on data from court (divorce) files and semi-structured interviews, it provides an intersectional critique of the laws for customary wives who seek to regulate marital dissolution through both judicial and extra-judicial systems. The article focuses specifically on the financial consequences of the dissolution of a customary marriage, one of the main criticisms of the Act. The RCMA was supposed to improve the entitlements of women in customary marriages; however, this study found that in practice the law is of little use to most poor, rural-based black South African women whose lives are far removed from any interaction with the state or norms generated by it. There are two main reasons for this: firstly, the rhetoric of rights and the provision of rights overlook the failure of the state to assist individuals in claiming the rights, and secondly, the strong belief held by divorcees and traditional leaders that marital assets belong to the husband (and husband's family or the marital family as it pertains to children) leads to resistance to an equal division of marital assets. The authors argue that a more dedicated and systematic effort which uses intersectionality in thinking about institutional transformation is required to curb financial exploitation upon the dissolution of a customary marriage.

J	Stern, E; Mirembe, J				Stern, Erin; Mirembe, Justine			Intersectionalities of formality of marital status and women's risk and protective factors for intimate partner violence in Rwanda	AGENDA-EMPOWERING WOMEN FOR GENDER EQUITY			English	Article						Rwanda; marriage; intersectionalities; violence; rights		Indashyikirwa is an intimate partner violence (IPV) prevention programme being implemented by CARE International Rwanda, Rwanda Women's Network and Rwanda Men's Resource Centre in Rwanda. One critical aspect of the programme is a 5-month curriculum to promote equitable, violence-free relationships among formally and informally married heterosexual couples. This article complements existing evidence in Rwanda around how formality of marital status influences women's access to rights, social status, risk and protective factors for IPV, and highlights barriers to formalising marriage - primarily lack of financial means and gendered inequalities. It draws on research of Indashyikirwa, including interviews with 15 male and 15 female partners of formally and informally married couples, 9 community leaders, 3 women's space facilitators, 9 staff members, 12 community activists and 24 focus groups with community members. Interviews and focus groups were conducted in Kinyarwanda, transcribed and translated into English, and analysed thematically. The findings indicate poor legal protection and related limited institutional responses for informally married women who experience IPV. An intersectional lens supports recommendations to address such inequalities, including raising awareness among women in informal marriages about strategies to ensure rights for themselves and their children, and to legally acknowledge informal unions after a certain period of cohabitation.

J	Mkhize, G; Cele, N				Mkhize, Gabi; Cele, Nokuthula			The role of women in tourism in KwaZulu-Natal: Case studies from the South Coast of KwaZulu-Natal	AGENDA-EMPOWERING WOMEN FOR GENDER EQUITY			English	Article						women; tourism; gender; patriarchy; intersectionality; rural; development; democracy	AFRICA; GENDER	In precolonial Africa patriarchal divisions of labour by gender emphasised and reinforced normative' women's productive and reproductive roles (Guy, 1987; Eldredge, 1993). Vertical control of labour power by men denied most women the possession of cattle and land, which were the primary source of wealth. Such unequal relations bolstered chiefly power and precolonial state formation in Africa. Colonial and apartheid penetration in South Africa (SA) tapped into these local relations of gendered power, sometimes entrenching patriarchal schemas in collaboration with African men to suit colonial interests (Schmidt, 1992). These precolonial, colonial and apartheid patriarchal and gendered relations of power continued to be sustained within the public and private domains of SA (Bozzoli, 1983). The liberation struggle, and the Truth and Reconciliation Committee in the 1990s addressed political issues in the hope that political freedoms would inevitably tackle other wider social struggles. Such disparities in approach to freedom left the agency of previously disadvantaged groups, notably women, outside the scope of political attention, and frustrated women's attempts to balance their pre-1994 accounts with the discourse of a democratic SA. Literature has much to say about how tourism benefits in the new SA should be extended to previously disadvantaged communities, mainly black people. As part of Local Economic Development vision and tourism policy initiative, the South African Government promotes a pro-poor tourism development strategy, local community participation, skills development, job creation, poverty reduction and, ultimately, tourism-based economic developments in black residential areas such as townships and rural villages. Examination of the current literature, however, suggests that gender inequality remains a strong component in tourism. Such unequal, gender-based relations impinge on the development of black African rural women in tourism. Using a case study of the South Coast of KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) this article discusses the intersection of race and gender in the study of tourism in KZN and SA in general. It concludes that as the tourism industry grows in SA, attention should be given to analysis of the role of women, specifically black African rural women, as one of the innovative paradigms in tourism. There is a need for a fresh focus on the subjective development, fundamental issues and competitive advantage of black African rural women striving for a fair chance in the tourism economy.

J	Thompson, JA; Gaskin, SJ; Agbor, M				Thompson, Jennifer A.; Gaskin, Susan J.; Agbor, Magdaline			Embodied intersections: Gender, water and sanitation in Cameroon	AGENDA-EMPOWERING WOMEN FOR GENDER EQUITY			English	Article						gender; intersectionality; water; participatory visual methodologies; Cameroon	INFRASTRUCTURE; POLITICS; HEALTH	A cornerstone of feminist thinking, intersectionality offers a critical analytical tool for exploring how gender intersects with other social structures of power. However, this leaves intersectionality grounded firmly in social analysis. Becoming increasingly salient are the complex political and material relations between social power, infrastructure and water (Linton and Budds, 2014). Intersectionality - centring the entanglement of difference - offers an opportunity to explore the interplay between social relations and difference in the physical world (Thompson, 2016). Drawing on participatory visual research with women and men across four communities in Cameroon, we elaborate how gendered social relations intersect with the material dimensions of water and sanitation. Given gendered and age-based divisions of labour, women and girls play a primary role in household water management. This article centres on women's concerns about everyday water access, use and control to elaborate how intersectional social dynamics in relation to water also intersect with water in the physical world. Expanding intersectional thinking beyond the social realm, we also demonstrate how gendered intersections shape and are shaped by the material and physical dimensions of water. This suggests that theorising about social difference alone risks missing how environmental factors influence different groups' experiences of power, privilege and oppression.

The emancipatory spaces that activists at Ladyfest seek to cultivate through workshops, music, and art provide seeds of inspiration for transformative social change. The main strength of the festival is the capacity to strengthen networks. This article discusses how the idea for this festival arose in Olympia, Washington, expanded to other locations, and was later organized by young feminists in Romania. In 2005, young women in Timisoara organized the first such festival in their city with a community of women from both inside and outside of Romania, and held another festival in Bucharest in 2007. Retrospective interviews are used to unpack the meaning of such organizing in a post-socialist context with reflections on how feminism has changed in Romania over the past decade. Specifically, the analysis of this event offers insight on how the production of space can be used to catalyze interconnections between emancipatory feminist spaces, the mode of production, and flows of feminist knowledge and concepts.

J	Johnson, M				Johnson, Mark			Gendering pastoral power: masculinity, affective labour and competitive bonds of solidarity among Filipino migrant men in Saudi Arabia	GENDER PLACE AND CULTURE			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Workshop on Transnationalism, Gender Hierarchies and Masculinity in Asia	MAR 11-12, 2013	Natl Univ Singapore, Asia Res Inst, Singapore, SINGAPORE	Forum Asian Studies	Natl Univ Singapore, Asia Res Inst	Masculinity; migration; pastoral power; care; affective labour	STATE; PROTECTION; PATRIARCHY; LONDON; WOMEN	This article draws on Foucault's concept of pastoral power to understand Filipino men's care work and the making of migrant masculinities in Saudi Arabia. Feminist scholars have indicated the gendered nature of pastoral power and emphasized what Young refers to as the logic of masculinist protection' that characterizes the contemporary security state. However, the notion of pastoral power invites further consideration of the taken for granted cultural assumptions about the way that hegemonic masculinity and forms of homosociality are characterized mainly by aggression, competition and dominance. Men's talk about and practical involvement in assisting fellow migrants in diasporic settings foregrounds the way that an ethics of care runs up against and is entangled with the competitive bonds of masculine solidarities. While markers of material success are privileged in measuring migrant men's accomplishments in country of origin, practices of care become central to men's achievement of symbolic power and social legitimacy especially among their peers in the diaspora. That spatialization is also linked to temporally shifting models of masculinity and normative expectations about men over the life course.

However, calls for more work, or better work for women (and men) doesn't necessarily solve the issues surrounding waged labour such as zero hour contracts, the double work day', and other forms of increasing precarity and competition. In this article I explore how alternative forms of labour exchange in the Wellington Timebank provide one way in which subjects can partially operate outside the waged economy. I draw on Jacques Ranciere's understanding of how a radical equality underpins a democratic politics to explore the everyday negotiations around labour that occur in this alternative economy. I connect work being done by the Community Economies Collective to ideas of radical equality and a feminist ethic of care to show how embodied and everyday practices like timebanking enable subjects to challenge the inequalities of waged work and in Ranciere's terms, partially construct alternative distributions of the sensible'.

J	Freeman, C				Freeman, Cordelia			The crime of choice: abortion border crossings from Chile to Peru	GENDER PLACE AND CULTURE			English	Article						Abortion; reproductive rights; biopolitics; Chile; Peru; border crossings	LATIN-AMERICA; MATERIALISM; FEMINISMS; POLICIES; ACCESS	Since 1989 abortion in Chile has been illegal in every single circumstance. This means that tens of thousands of women every year undergo clandestine abortions at great risk to their health. Class directly influences Chilean women's relationships to abortion; wealthier women can pay for the confidentiality of a safe doctor whereas poorer women cannot. There is just one region where women regardless of class can easily travel to another country in search of abortions, Arica in northern Chile. This article considers the previously unstudied phenomenon whereby women cross the border quickly and cheaply from northern Chile to the Peruvian city of Tacna where numerous clinics offer the procedure. This article utilises Foucault's concept of biopolitics to trace how women are forced to cross a border to avoid government legislation and finds that even by leaving the territory of the state, women do not fully leave state control. Despite the lack of official statistics, interviews with healthworkers and a young woman who made the crossing show that abortion border crossings do occur and this article reflects on the legal, safety, and biopolitical ramifications of these journeys for Chilean women.

Informed by a feminist engagement with Merleau-Ponty's concepts of the body-subject', the flesh' and Einfuhlung, the article places subjectivity within a relational ontology of sentience and intelligence in which corporeal experiences, senses and affects condition cognitive and agential processes. Bodily senses and affects are thus treated as media of subjectivity. The relationship between water and identity, established through memory, heritage and history, is also produced and/or conserved by the embodied relation between women's bodies and bodies of water, within the connective flesh' of the physical world. The case of the Eastern Black Sea demonstrates how political subjectivity of women in the movement against HPPs is conditioned by an intimate embodied relationship with river waters that is sustained by a series of sensory-affective experiences. Their statements emphasize, over and over again, an interconnectedness with the rivers, which makes the cause of anti-HPP struggle vital and urgent for them. This feeling of urgency is a source of women's radicalism in opposing HPPs. The article maintains the female subject as embodied and transversal, and stresses the centrality of corporeal experience, sense and affect in formation of political subjectivity. By developing a body-centred feminist-phenomenological approach to political subjectivity, it introduces a novel way of analysing women's activisms within and beyond environmental movements.

The role of women in payment for environmental services programs in Osa, Costa Rica	GENDER PLACE AND CULTURE			English	Article						Costa Rica; gender; patriarchal hierarchies; payment for ecosystem services; payment for environmental services; women	LATIN-AMERICA; ECOSYSTEM SERVICES; GENDER; POVERTY; DEFORESTATION; EFFICIENCY; PENINSULA; GEOGRAPHY; DYNAMICS; ACCESS	Costa Rica was the first country in the world to implement a nation-wide payment for environmental services (a.k.a. payment for ecosystem services'), or PES, system in 1996. This research investigates the role of women in PES programs in Costa Rica's Osa peninsula in response to the current dearth of such gendered research on this topic. Osa, one of the least-developed regions of the country, is still heavily forested and replete with properties under PES contracts which are aimed at forest conservation. Extended, structured interviews of 80 landowners in Osa (40 women and 40 men) culled both quantitative and qualitative information about PES participation, environmental perceptions, and both economic and conservation goals. Salient results were, first, that women see current levels of PES funding as more helpful and useful than do men. Second, women much more often perceive themselves as the sole entity responsible for protecting the environment. Third, women more commonly than men listed helping the environment and animals' as a personal benefit of their PES participation, while men more commonly focused on financial rewards. Last, according to the study herein, women in PES households currently display less decision-making power than those in non-PES households. This dynamic is analyzed through the lens of patriarchal hierarchies as well as women's mitigation of those hierarchies through the deployment of ideology and agency. Based on these general findings, the researcher recommends that FONAFIFO, the government agency in charge of PES payments, take specific steps to increase PES funding to female-headed households.

This essay establishes some relation between Marquesa de Alorna and the contemporary Portuguese poet, Maria Teresa Horta and among these two writers and the tradition of Portuguese lyrics. To achieve this, using the comparative method, it is necessary to understand the biographical trajectory of both writers and also to develop a brief analysis of recurrent themes on their work, even though, some of these themes appear in different perspectives in each one. The main themes are love (denying and invocation); tradition and rupture; politic commitment.

It becomes more important when it comes to a women's movement, as we still live in a society governed by patriarchal values that discriminate against and oppress women.

The study was conducted at the Specialized Women's Police Station - Teresina Downtown. It is characterized as a qualitative research, with a descriptive-exploratory character, using semistructured interview as data collection technique. The results indicated the presence of sexist discourses and blame of women in the face of the violence suffered. So as the lack of qualification of the subjects of the research, the lack of knowledge about the Maria da Penha Law, and the disrepute in relation to it which became preponderant for the questioning of the quality of attendance, contrary to what is proposed in the specific Law.

In addition, we question how the paid work routine modifies women's relationships with their husbands and with herself. Suggesting that the wage-labor routine is linked to gradual processes of awareness of who they are and what they can expect from marital and personal life.

Whether they are feminist, by and for women, by and for lesbians, queer, educational, alternative or indie, all of those pornographic productions contain a critical discourse on mainstream pornography. This article presents a review of critical pornography initiatives from the perspective of women director and as presented in the academic literature. In addition to identifying the different categories, we will focus on understanding the links between those initiatives and pro-sex feminist thought, as well as some of its specific indicators like women's sexual agency, the centrality of feminine pleasure, and the subversion of mainstream pornography's codes.

J	Lavoie-Moore, M				Lavoie-Moore, Myriam			<< Trying to avoid >>, << trying to conceive >> : (re) producing a paradoxical feminity through quantification	GENRE SEXUALITE & SOCIETE			French	Article						Quantification apps; gender; fertility; informational empowerment; body-project		By following physiological signs of the fertility cycle of women, it is possible to produce information on oneself that can be seen as an alternative technique to hormonal and chirurgical contraception and conception's help. Since 2009, some digital applications (apps) help that kind of activity by quantifying the fertility cycle. The problematic is complex because it reproduces a representation of the feminine that should respect her reproductive nature at the same time it promotes an ideal of informational self-control that suggests to dominate this same nature. This article aims to understand how a technology that should manage and control fertility (re) produces the categories of gender. Our approach links the production of a feminine subjectivity to the production of a neoliberal subjectivity. It helps us to explore what are the forms of those categories of gender and how they take shape within the application. The discourse surrounding the fertility app Kindara claims that the realization of women's empowerment relies on the informational control of oneself, an << informational empowerment >>. The case study of this app shows how this ideal of empowerment, associated to the one of the self-realization by having a child, can create an unempowering feeling for the women that are unable to have a child because of the construction of a narrative of a woman that should be in control of her body.

Analysis of the gossip press coverage on the Queen from 2011 to 2014	JOURNAL OF GENDER STUDIES			English	Article						Gender stereotypes; Spain; Queen Sofia; womanhood; Hola; gossip press	GENDER STEREOTYPES; CELEBRITY	The article analyses framing of Queen Sofia by the Spanish gossip press as an embodiment of the traditionalist model of womanhood existing in Spain. The paper presents results from the content analysis of extensive press coverage on the Consort (173 articles published between May 2011 and May 2014) from the leading gossip magazine Hola! Through the use of gender stereotypes' categorization, it displays a coherence between the content of the Queen's discourse in the magazine and the conservative vision of womanhood developed within the Spanish patriarchal model. Final results show that despite a superficial modernization of the Queen's image obtained thanks to the fact of focusing the discourse on her public activity, Hola! frame on Queen Sofia corresponds to the portrayal of the ideal of traditionalist Spanish woman. She is thus presented in roles of a mother, grandmother and wife rather than an independent and professionally accomplished woman. Moreover, she is described as a strongly emotional woman, worshipping her family, whose public actions are motivated more by a feeling of obligation toward her family and the country than by a will of having a professional career.

This article draws on interview data from an Australian study which aimed to explore what it meant to be a young woman' in neoliberal late modernity, and in relation to the paradoxes of post-feminism. Though there has been an unprecedented rise in youth post-secondary school participation in Australia and elsewhere, girls' and young women's increased investment and participation in education has not provided the same gains as for their male counterparts. All interview participants described being aware of gender inequalities and gender discrimination in the workplace, including the glass ceiling, the gender pay gap, and demands and pressures on women to balance career and motherhood, however many did not associate these issues with feminism'. We explore the dynamics of notions of equality, difference and the body in participants' discussions of work and their anticipation of motherhood and the logics by which gender inequalities are sustained.

J	Gresaker, AK				Gresaker, Ann Kristin			"If your life feels empty, perhaps it's time to find a partner?' Constructions of heterosexual coupledom and femininity through astrological advice in a Norwegian women's magazine	JOURNAL OF GENDER STUDIES			English	Article						Norwegian women's magazines; horoscopes; heterosexual courtship; happiness; femininities; post-feminism	CHICK LIT; POSTFEMINISM; DISCOURSES; SELF	The notion that happiness is found in heterosexual coupledom is a persistent theme in popular women's genre such as women's magazines. The emergence of post-feminist discourses demonstrates that such conventional scripts are presented in new manners, now emphasising freedom, choice and female empowerment. The present article explores the expressions of post-feminism in an understudied cultural and media context: the Norwegian women's magazine Det Nye's horoscope section. The article compares horoscopes published over three decades (1988, 1998 and 2008), covering periods before and during the rise of post-feminism. Through the themes of how to meet, choose and catch men, the article asks: In what ways does the astrologer talk of the quest for heterosexual coupledom? What kinds of femininity are promoted through the quest for love? What changes are there in constructions of femininity, and what prevails? The article finds that the couple relationship alters from being constructed as an inevitable happy object that makes few demands on women, to a happy choice and an achievement that subsequently involves an all-encompassing project into which women need to put all their efforts. The study reveals a shift from a discourse of luck in 1988 to post-feminist and neo-liberalist discourses of empowerment and self-management particularly evident in 2008.

Although permissive and liberal discourses construct women's casual sex as acceptable, and even desirable, traditional discourses and a sexual double standard, do not. This article examines 15 young women's negotiation of the sexual double standard in their talk of heterosexual casual sex. Interviews were analysed using thematic analysis, with borrowed insights from discourse analysis, within a constructionist framework. All 15 women in this study gave accounts of an agentic and desiring sexuality, yet talked about casual sex and a sexual reputation in contradictory and contested ways. Three main themes were identified: the (un)acceptability of casual sex, a sexual reputation is what other girls have, and the making of a slut. Although an enduring sexual double standard was identified, all participants challenged its relevance and appropriateness. However, a sexual double standard also seeped into women's accounts when talking about other women and the threat of garnering a negative sexual reputation was linked to women's silencing of their own casual sex experiences. This work supports the continued need to dismantle un/changing codes of gendered heterosexuality.

Intersections of gender and water: comparative approaches to everyday gendered negotiations of water access in underserved areas of Accra, Ghana and Cape Town, South Africa	JOURNAL OF GENDER STUDIES			English	Article						Ghana; South Africa; gender; water; methods; triangulation; intersectionality	EMOTIONAL DISTRESS; GEOGRAPHIES; INSECURITY; KNOWLEDGE; QUESTION	A large and growing body of literature suggests that women and men often have differentiated relationships to water access, uses, knowledges, governance, and experiences. From a feminist political ecology perspective, these relationships can be mediated by gendered labour practices (within the household, at the community level, or within the workplace), socio-cultural expectations (e.g. related to notions of masculinity and femininity), as well as intersectional differences (e.g. race, income, and so forth). While these relationships are complex, multiple, and vary by context, it is frequently argued that due to responsibility for domestic provision or other pathways, women may be particularly affected if water quality or access is compromised. This paper reports on a statistical evaluation of a 478 household survey conducted in underserved areas of Accra, Ghana and Cape Town, South Africa in early 2012. Interrogating our survey results in the light of the ideas of gender differentiated access, uses, knowledges, governance, and experiences of water, we open up considerations related to the context of each of our study sites, and also invite possible revisions and new directions for these debates. In particular, we are interested in the instances where differences among male and female respondents were less pronounced than expected. Highlighting these unexpected results we find it helpful to draw attention to methods - in particular we argue that a binary male-female approach is not that meaningful for the analysis, and instead, gender analysis requires some attention to intersectional differences (e.g. homeownership, employment, or age). We also make the case for the importance of combining qualitative and quantitative work to understand these relationships, as well as opening up what might be learned by more adequately exploring the resonances and tensions between these approaches.

J	Margolin, L				Margolin, Leslie			Sexual frigidity: the social construction of masculine privilege and feminine pathology	JOURNAL OF GENDER STUDIES			English	Article						Sexuality; culture; gender; frigidity; medical history	IMPOTENCE	This study examines how mid-twentieth century physicians used the term sexual frigidity' to disempower women. Conceptualizing medical texts as accounts, I focus on how medical authors saw, described and explained sexual frigidity from the 1930s to the 1960s in both scientific writings and in those aimed at the general public as sex guides, marriage manuals and advice columns. The study concludes, that behind the pretext of treating a woman's frigidity, psychiatrists and gynecologists, using the language and theoretical structures of psychoanalysis, constructed a narrative in which normal', non-frigid women always see their man through a lens of unlimited patience, tenderness and altruism. Their attitude is always welcoming, joyous, and worshipful. By contrast, women defined as sexually frigid see their man through a lens of bitterness and resentment, an attitude which reaches its apotheosis during the man's attempts to engage them in intercourse. Through the frigidity narrative, mid-twentieth century physicians managed to pass judgment, not only on women's sexuality, but on their autonomy, their character, and the success or failure of their marriage: they are to blame when their husband leaves them for another woman; they are to blame when their husband is impotent; and they only have themselves to blame if they are unable to function in a sexually healthy' way. The discourse that seemed preoccupied with a woman's genitals, with their feelings and contractions, was also interested in a woman's heart, her intentions and activities, with particular emphasis on how she performed as her husband's housekeeper and companion. There was scarcely an attitude, feeling, or interpersonal activity known to women from which mid-twentieth century physicians did not impute some connection to frigidity.

J	Jones, L; Mills, S; Paterson, LL; Turner, G; Coffey-Glover, L				Jones, Lucy; Mills, Sara; Paterson, Laura L.; Turner, Georgina; Coffey-Glover, Laura			Identity and naming practices in British marriage and civil partnerships	GENDER AND LANGUAGE			English	Article						marriage; surnames; heteronormativity; naming; feminism	GENDER; NAME; POWER	This article demonstrates the continued prevalence of traditional, heteronormative practices regarding marriage and naming practices in Britain, and also considers the complex choices made by same-sex couples who marry in relation to whether there are any benefits in changing their surname. The study draws on data from an online survey of 1,000 UK respondents, and reveals that it continues to be viewed as more 'normal' for a woman to take her husband's surname in a heterosexual union than for her to make any other choice. While other options (such as the woman retaining the surname given to her by her parents, for instance) are often considered in relation to heterosexual marriage, these continue to be seen as a deviation from the norm. We find that the role of tradition is critical to heterosexual women's decisions over what to do with their surname, whether they follow the culturally expected route or consciously deviate from it. Same-sex couples are broadly perceived to have comparably more freedom than heterosexuals regarding their names, and here we analyse whether this is the case. Through qualitative critical analysis of the discursive responses of those completing our survey, and some quantitative discussion of the data, we demonstrate that heteronormative assumptions about a woman's role in a heterosexual relationship have continued salience and that this leads to a conscious and often difficult negotiation of her own identity as both an individual and a wife.

J	Cresswell, C				Cresswell, Catherine			Female agency in action: an examination of interactions in an online 'Love and Relationships' discussion forum	GENDER AND LANGUAGE			English	Article						MHEALTH; CONVERSATION ANALYSIS; FEMALE AGENCY; ADOLESCENT RELATIONSHIPS; SOUTH AFRICA	SOUTH-AFRICA; ADOLESCENTS; CONSTRUCTION; MOTHERHOOD; HIV/AIDS; VIOLENCE; CONTEXT; GENDER; GIRLS; WOMEN	This study examined the discursive and interactional processes by which adolescent female participants present and discuss their romantic relationships in a 'Love and Relationships' MXit forum, a mobile phone-based project created by the South African non-governmental organisation, HIVSA. In doing so, it was possible to explore some of the norms and 'taken-for-granted' practices of romantic relationships that the participants describe, which offered insight into present research into adolescent experiences of gender and romantic relationships, as well as new subjects for consideration during intervention or analysis. In particular, it is suggested that because conceptions of love and having children appeared not to be foreclosed normative practices, these could prove fertile points of intervention with young women's choices, agency, and ultimately, empowerment. This study thus recommends disseminating and increasing the scope of hi4LIFE and similar projects that provide platforms for the production of female agency.

J	Formato, F				Formato, Federica			Ci sono troie in giro in Parlamento che farebbero di tutto': Italian female politicians seen through a sexual lens	GENDER AND LANGUAGE			English	Article						GENDER; ITALIAN; SEXIST LANGUAGE; NEXUS ANALYSIS; FEMALE POLITICIANS	SEXISM; WOMEN	Italian female politicians are increasingly gaining access to the institutional public space, in some cases breaking the glass ceiling that has blocked them from reaching high positions. However, language used to attack them for their possible wrong doings or employed to represent themselves demonstrates that a rearrangement of a gendered fixed order is constantly challenged by (those in) a culture and society that still see women as mainly pertaining to the private sphere. In this article, I qualitatively investigate sexual terms, directly and indirectly sexist, used by a variety of actors (journalists, comedians, politicians) attempting to prove women's unsuitability for political roles and, more broadly, for operating in the institutional public sphere. To examine these terms, I developed a framework which takes into consideration communicative functions (stereotypes, gossip and self-representation), aimed at providing a comprehensive and context-dependent investigation into how language is purposefully used to re-establish a known gendered structure (only men in the institutional sphere). Nexus analysis, borrowed from anthropologists Ron Scollon and Suzanne Scollon, is here performed in order to show how language is intrinsically linked to an ideologically gendered order which speakers seem to reproduce through linguistic practices. This article contributes to previous literature on Italy as a highly sexist culture as well as that on representation of female professionals operating in domains which have been historically inhabited by men. It also offers a methodological tool to investigate sexist terms employed in the media and in political spaces.

J	Taylor, C				Taylor, Charlotte			Women are bitchy but men are sarcastic? Investigating gender and sarcasm	GENDER AND LANGUAGE			English	Article						MOCK POLITENESS; SARCASM; GENDER; CORPUS PRAGMATICS	VERBAL IRONY; IMPOLITENESS; PERSPECTIVE	In this paper I investigate one aspect of the relationship between gender and mock politeness, focusing in particular on sarcastic behaviours. Previous research into sarcasm as an academic concept has suggested that it is more likely to be performed by male speakers. In the British forum data analysed here, there was no correlation between performances of mock politeness and gender. However, there was a preference for labelling male mock polite behaviour as sarcastic, suggesting that the correlation is not between the academic concept of sarcasm and the male behaviour, but between the choice of metapragmatic label and gender of person described. The analysis draws on corpus linguistics, supplemented by survey data, to further describe the relationship between the metapragmatic labels sarcastic and bitchy and gender of the performer.

J	Galvan, M				Galvan, Margaret			Archiving Wimmen: Collectives, Networks, and Comix	AUSTRALIAN FEMINIST STUDIES			English	Article								Wimmen's Comix, an underground comix series, featured the contributions of roughly 100 women in its two decades of existence: 1972-1992. Its preservation in physical and digital archives often prioritises prolific creators, effectively erasing the contributions of a majority of the women, nearly half of whom contributed just once to the series. Through an analysis of this series and its status in archives, this essay examines how archival practices bury visual media. Through studying how this series is organised across a number of archives, I suggest better ways to archive these works that echo their collective politics and honour women's hybrid media forms. In critiquing physical and digital archives, I argue that a feminist politic must govern the structuring of such spaces. To represent this media better, I propose that we embrace the idea of the network as a method for organising these materials in archives.

This article traces the AWAP's development within the changing context of archival science over that period. Using the insights of feminist archival theory it explores how a feminist approach to archival practice can inform thinking about how to manage community archives, empowering those who create them to participate in societal memory with their own voice and values. It shows how the AWAP is a fledgling example of where distinctions between archivist, records creator, subject and user are blurred in the quest for a space that facilitates co-creation of archival infrastructure.

J	Ashton, J				Ashton, Jenna			Feminist Archiving [a manifesto continued]: Skilling for Activism and Organising	AUSTRALIAN FEMINIST STUDIES			English	Article								This article outlines the potential of a model of material and digital feminist archiving that sits within a wider context of feminist activism and organising. It argues that feminist archiving is a circular process of creating the society we want to be evidenced, and contributes to the skilling of women and girls for activism and organising. The article specifically responds to A Manifesto of Feminist Archiving (or disruption)', produced by arts and heritage organisation Digital Women's Archive North CIC (UK) and its suggested methodological approaches of Intervention, Living and Reimagined. The Manifesto calls for an active relationship with the archiveone that conceptually and physically rethinks best practice for managing and creating collections. The Manifesto identifies five possible intervention points (Selection, Type, Facilitation, Storage and Time, Access). Documenting and collecting is a significant part of feminist archiving, but additional processes of rethinking access, interpretation, uses and creation of new structures are facets that will ensure a wider social relevance and application.

J	Hunter, KM				Hunter, Kathryn M.			Silence in Noisy Archives: Reflections on Judith Allen's "Evidence and Silence - Feminism and the Limits of History' (1986) in the Era of Mass Digitisation	AUSTRALIAN FEMINIST STUDIES			English	Article							AUSTRALIA	Feminist historians have long been concerned with the silencing of women's voices and experiences in archives. In 1986 Judith Allen was one of many feminists pushing back against the positivist idea that history comprised only those traces of the past that could be salvaged in the present. Archives are radically different now in breadth, composition, production and technologies to those in which Allen was working, but are her concerns about the nature of evidence and silence still pertinent? While digitisation, for example, has made more visible those who were previously obscured in historical records, are silence and silencing practices still a feminist problem three decades on from Allen's salvo?

J	Gudjonsdottir, G; Skaptadottir, UD				Gudjonsdottir, Gudbjort; Skaptadottir, Unnur Dis			Migrating Within "the Gender-equal Nordic Region": Icelandic Migrants in Norway and the Gendered Division of Work and Care	NORA-NORDIC JOURNAL OF FEMINIST AND GENDER RESEARCH			English	Article						Gender; migration; division of labour; transnational families; Iceland; Norway	PERSPECTIVE; MOBILITIES; POLISH; FAMILY; ISSUE; LABOR; GAP	Migration is a gendered process that shapes the lives of men and women differently, because they generally occupy dissimilar positions within the household, the labour market, and society. This article examines gender and migration within a Nordic context, between two countries that are often presented as gender-equal in cross-national comparisons. The focus is on how the gendered division of labour is manifested in the experiences of Icelanders who migrated to Norway in the wake of the Icelandic financial crisis of October 2008. The results are based on interviews with people who migrated to Norway both with and without their families. In our analysis, we show how the gender-segregated labour market and gender norms lead to different positions and opportunities for men and women at times of economic crisis and migration. For study participants who migrated with their families, the relocation was often organized around the labour-market position and opportunities of men. Those who migrated without their families emphasized their roles as providers for their families. However, only the women described how their absence was perceived as a failure to fulfil childcare responsibilities. The findings highlight the resilience of the notions of men as providers and women as primary parents within the gender-equal Nordic region, and indicate how these roles may facilitate or discourage the migration of men and women.

J	Norocel, OC				Norocel, Ov Cristian			Akesson at Almedalen: Intersectional Tensions and Normalization of Populist Radical Right Discourse in Sweden	NORA-NORDIC JOURNAL OF FEMINIST AND GENDER RESEARCH			English	Article						Intersectionality; Almedalen; populist radical right; Sweden; discourse-historical approach	GENDER; DEMOCRATS; POLITICS; NATIONALISM; EQUALITY; AUSTRIA; PARTIES; NORWAY; WOMEN	This study analyses the populist radical right discourse of the Sweden Democrats (Sverigedemokraterna, SD), examining how Jimmie angstrom kesson, the SD chairperson, conceptualized gendered social positions in the folkhem ([Swedish] people's home) in his annual speeches in Almedalen, since the SD entered the Swedish Parliament in 2010 to date. Attention is being paid to whose voices are allowed to come forth and in which manner this is done, and to how inequalities intersecting gender and ethnicity are explained and reproduced, as means to normalize populist radical right discourse in Sweden. Theoretically, the study rests on the conceptualization of the populist radical right as a thin-centred ideology, which is contingently adapted to national politics, to which it ads intersectionality from above as a specific analytical perspective. The discourse-historical approach (DHA) provides the methodological tools for the analysis and facilitates its contextual positioning. The article contributes analytically to the field, shedding light on how, in the context of populist radical right discourse, welfare chauvinist appeals are employed formally to acknowledge the importance of gender equality in Sweden, and are used as a device to contour two antithetic entities: the supposedly gender-equal Swedish ethnic majority as the opposite of the allegedly deeply patriarchal migrant Other. The article also contributes empirically to the study of the populist radical right in Sweden. It provides a more nuanced picture of the party's ideological transformations in what is envisaged to be their ideological normalizationfrom fringe nationalism (antidemocratic national socialism) and outright racism to welfare chauvinism and cultural racism (Islamophobic exclusionary nationalism) in conservative clothing.

Taking a doing-gender perspective as the starting point, this study explores how gender constructions embedded in Swedish eye clinics contribute to longer waiting times for women than for men. Focus group interviews were conducted with doctors at two Swedish eye clinics: one with a larger and another with a smaller than average gender difference in waiting times for CE. Several differences were found between the clinics regarding how gender was constructed: Women and men were constructed as different with respect to ascribed traits such as assertiveness and care-seeking behaviour. Their need for visual acuity in working life was perceived as different by the doctors, and the study indicates differences between the clinics regarding their interest and awareness concerning issues related to inequity, reflected in the dissimilar prevalence of jokes with racist and misogynist connotations at the two clinics.

The analysis is based on a study involving 20 imprisoned women, who either sent a written account or were interviewed. The analysis draws upon critical discursive psychology and Sara Ahmed's theorization of emotions. Hence, it focuses on the affective and discursive processes through which the women participating in the study enact identities in their narratives about their involvement with violence. These enactments are conceptualized as affective identificatory practices in which gendered, socio-culturally circulating meanings and valuations become entwined with personal histories in locally variant ways. Four different groups of selves that emerged from the participants' narratives are discussed: victimized selves, defender selves, lost selves, and rehabilitated/unrehabilitatable selves. By looking at the constitution of these selves in close detail, I put forward a reading in which the participants are seen as primarily striving to enact autonomous identities and hence to subvert devaluation by distancing themselves from vulnerability, which threatens their integrity as subjects.

J	Collins, PH				Collins, Patricia Hill			The Difference That Power Makes: Intersectionality and Participatory Democracy	INVESTIGACIONES FEMINISTAS			English	Article						Black feminism; Intersectionality; Participatory democracy; Power; Resistance		This essay explores how developing more complex analyses of power and politics sheds light on important themes for both intersectionality and participatory democracy. First of all, drawn from intersectional inquiry, the article outlines three focal points of a power analytic: how analyses of intersecting, structural oppressions underpin systems of domination; how a domains-of-power framework provides a set of conceptual tools for analyzing and responding to intersecting power relations; and how a more robust analysis of the collective illuminates the political action of subordinated groups. From this power analytic, the essay examines power and politics from the standpoint of the resistance traditions of historically subordinated groups, especially African American women's political action. Finally, the article discusses implications of intersectionality's power analytic for projects for intersectionality and participatory democracy. Related to this, intersectionality conceptualization from Black feminism in flexible, pragmatic terms constitutes an important site for seeing the deepening commitment to participatory democracy as an alternative to technical agendas of the state.

J	Goikoetxea, IG				Gandarias Goikoetxea, Itziar			A buzzword?: Rethinking the intersectionality as a tool for feminist political articulation	INVESTIGACIONES FEMINISTAS			Spanish	Article						Intersectionality; black feminist theory; articulation; oppressions; privileges	TRANSNATIONAL FEMINISM	Intersectionality is considered one of the major contributions to gender and feminist studies in recent decades. Despite this, some theorists are suspicious of the current uncritical use and fetishization of intersectionality and others see it as as a buzzword. Based on the experience of articulation of the Platform of the World March of Women of the Basque Country, this text explores some of the tensions that arise when implementing intersectionality. In order to recover its radical and transformative character originating in black feminisms, three challenges of intersectionality are presented as a tool for political articulation: (i) addressing the interrelationship between subjectivity and intersectionality (ii) its re-politicization and radicalization and (iii) the commitment to a situated and contingent intersectionality. More than an expired notion, intersectionality is presented as a tool with a political and theoretical potential yet to be explored.

The case of Portugal has been of particular interest since the country features a long tradition of involving civil society in the making of equality policies. This article revisits the Portuguese case in order to analyse recent developments. First, the participatory and coordinated approach adopted so far to deal with inequalities is described. Second, the analysis focuses on gender-based violence policies to help capturing new advancements. These policies have been recently enlarged to tackle the situation of women at the intersections and civil society actors have been actively involved in the policy-making process. In particular, the case of policies to combat female genital mutilation illustrates how participatory structures contribute to bring an intersectional perspective. The analysis of the Portuguese case allows thus reflecting on the potential benefits of democratising intersectionality as well as its limits.

A qualitative and intersectional approach	INVESTIGACIONES FEMINISTAS			Spanish	Article						Intersectionality; sorority; migrant women; partnership; inequality		In the last decades, studies from feminist perspectives have questioned the monolithic use of "woman" category and they have demonstrated an increasing interest in other types of considerations such as ethnicity, nationality or the social class. From this standpoint - feminist and intersectional-, this study focuses on the partnership of the migrant women of Biscay, which constitutes a rich source of knowledge. The qualitative methodology, which is based on focus groups, allows us to approach the interaction between multiple inequalities affecting the migrant women's lives and placing them in particular vulnerable situations. However, above all, this qualitative approximation lets us recognise and study these structures as resilient spaces, which are capable of producing strategies for coping, sorority and democratic participation. The narratives of these migrant women bring out the mechanism of multiple domination systems, and at the same time, disclose the role that they and their partnership perform in welfare promotion, empowerment and also, in the fight against multiple inequalities.

For this purpose, we explore the case of the MovimientoCampesino de Santiago del Estero, from Argentina, and its connections with the feminist standpoints of the broader global organizations that the peasant movement is part of. Our approach is ethnographic, based on field work, interviews to activist women and the analysis of written sources. Findings suggest that the organization has elaborated its own significant frame in relation to gender and it is trying to solve some tensions in between difference feminism or ecofeminism, extended in the region, and a perspective based on equality amidst sexes, grounded on their local political experience.

In Italy, cultural factors and low availability of formal childcare services define gender roles that are generally based on the male breadwinner model, in which childcare is almost completely entrusted to women. The analysis is carried out through an extension of the Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition and is based on data from the 2007 Italian National Institute for Workers' Professional Development (ISFOL). The results are consistent with gender discrimination on wages and suggest that women's occupational paths are often an outcome of limited choices, and that women's unpaid domestic work negatively interferes with the energy women can put into paid work. These findings support the need to ensure gender equality in and out of the labor market, especially through deep changes in Italian social norms and through the development of formal childcare.

However, the current estimates of costs in the literature provide the aggregate loss of income, but not the macroeconomic loss in terms of output and demand insofar as they fail to consider the structural interlinkages of the economy. Focusing on Vietnam, this study proposes an approach based on the social accounting matrix (SAM) to estimate the macroeconomic loss due to violence. Using Vietnam's 2011 SAM, the study estimates the income and multiplier loss due to VAW. From a policy point of view, the study argues that the macroeconomic loss due to VAW renders a permanent invisible leakage to the circular flow that can potentially destabilize, weaken, or neutralize the positive gains from government expenditure on welfare programs.

Evidence on Intimate Partner Violence from the Dominican Republic	FEMINIST ECONOMICS			English	Article						Intimate partner violence; household bargaining model; male backlash model; Dominican Republic; Caribbean and Latin America; B54; J12; 054	GAP	This essay explores the role of economic, political, and social factors in the incidence of intimate partner violence (IPV). It considers the extent to which two prominent theses on the determinants of IPV - (1) the household bargaining model (HBM), and (2) the male backlash model (MBM) - best explain this phenomenon in the case of the Dominican Republic. Drawing on the 2007 Demographic and Health Survey (DHS), which differentiates between physical and sexual IPV, results from logistic regressions reveal that the HBM better explains physical IPV, while the MBM better predicts sexual IPV. Further, the HBM does better accounting for IPV among wealthier women, while the MBM best explains IPV among poorer women. The findings suggest the need to reconsider broad programs and policies intended to prevent and ameliorate IPV in the Dominican Republic, and to implement targeted initiatives focusing on the economic factors motivating them.

Many studies have demonstrated that women-led farms perform less well as a result of less access to production factors, but no studies focus on how women perform without this constraint. This study fills that gap by analyzing the case of cotton cropping, which is known for its high labor requirements, high production inputs, and need for technical knowledge. Using primary data collected in northern China over the 2006-9 period, it uses the concept of Daily Crop Management (DCM) and identifies DCM farms managed by women whose husbands were engaged in off-farm activities on a long-term basis. The study finds that one-third of all farms were female-DCM farms, that these were smaller than those of their male counterparts but had equal access to production factors and achieved equal if not better technical and economic performances.

Evidence Based on Educational Groups in Uruguay	FEMINIST ECONOMICS			English	Article						Labor force participation; labor supply; women and work; C1; J22	FAMILY; WAGES; MODEL	This study uses Uruguay's historical fluctuation in real wages to set up a natural experiment to measure the relation between women's labor supply and wages. Using data from the Continuous Household Surveys of the Uruguayan National Statistics Institute, for 1986-2010, it aims to identify and explain heterogeneity in the labor supply behavior of women with different educational backgrounds. It finds that all women groups seek to optimize their remunerated work allocation throughout their life cycle, although women's labor behaviors vary depending on educational levels. The rising trend of women's labor force participation is expected to continue; its implications at the intensive margin are ambiguous and depend on how women conciliate paid work with household responsibilities - especially women with less education. These results could inform present debates about designing public policies to facilitate women's entry into the labor market and cater to their different wage profiles and household care demands.

This paper proposes to create a Global Fund for Women through Innovative Finance (GFWIF) with the ability to raise funds through innovative sources of finance on a scale more appropriate to the estimated requirements of making reasonable progress toward gender equality (US$31-107 billion per year in constant 2014 dollars). It builds on previous calls by feminist economists for the establishment of such funds through global forms of taxation. Since donors' commitments only meet the lower bound, the GFWIF could scale up funding for gender equality interventions commensurate with country needs. Global resource mobilization through innovative mechanisms, including allocations of new Special Drawing Rights, currency transaction taxes, and carbon taxes, have the potential to provide the necessary financing at a much faster pace than is currently possible.

Using data from the German Socio-Economic Panel from 1984-2012, this study compares three different age cohorts of first-time East and West German mothers to investigate whether there has been any convergence between East and West Germany in the way women use part-time employment. Results show that mothers in West Germany in all cohorts tended to remain in part-time employment for longer periods than those in East Germany. Part-time employment more often provided a stepping-stone into full-time employment in East Germany than in West Germany. East German women who gave birth after reunification were less likely than older cohorts to experience a transition from part-time to full-time work. Thus, part-time employment not followed by subsequent full-time work has become more common in the East.

Using a non-equilibrium structuralist macroeconomic model, it demonstrates that the dual aim of economic growth and increases in men's and women's employment can be achieved by adopting gender-sensitive expansionary macroeconomic policies. Based on historical data series, three scenarios for Europe for the 2015-25 period are compared: continued austerity, a gender-neutral expansionary scenario, and a gendered expansionary scenario. Projections for the gendered expansionary scenario suggest that 7.4 million more jobs could be created for women in the Eurozone and United Kingdom by reversing austerity policies and gendering and increasing government expenditure and private investment. Further, higher growth rates under this scenario lead to significant reductions of debt-to-GDP ratios and lower budget deficits. The study recommends Europe should roll back austerity policies and embark on a new gender-aware economic trajectory.

It uses a subjective well-being approach, based on self-reported happiness, to capture income and non-income aspects of employment. The study uses original survey data from 2013 for the Saint-Louis region in Senegal and an instrumental variable approach, supported by information from focus group discussions. It finds that women's employment improves subjective well-being for the poorest women, but not for women whose household income is above the poverty threshold. Women's employment improves women's happiness through an income effect, as it leads to higher income levels and improved living standards, but the non-income effects reduce women's happiness. This negative effect is related to a higher workload and low job satisfaction due to unfulfilled expectations. The positive income effect outweighs these negative non-income effects for poor women but not for relatively wealthier women.

In this article I explore why Portugal was faster than Spain in adopting key gender-rights policies (e.g., divorce, equal pay, state feminism) during the period in question. Bridging insights from the democratization, social movement, and women's studies literatures, I argue that Portugal's accelerated policy path on women's rights can be explained by three complex factors: (1) the nature of the revolutionary transition, which structured options for women's movements and for institutional actors; (2) the configuration of movement-party alliances; and (3) supranational pressures to reorganize the state-civil society relationship. The study contributes to the engendering of democratization processes in Iberia by paying close attention to the interconnected agency of women's movements with other political actors at a time of regime transformation.

Given that rural communities are often more homogeneous than metropolitan areas across several dimensions, this article asks whether young girls growing up in rural communities have higher levels of political knowledge and efficacy than those in more urban, diverse communities. It argues that the average girl benefits from the stronger social bonds between residents in smaller places, but young women who hold minority views about the importance of equality are likely to suffer in their levels of knowledge and efficacy. Being in the minority seems to be particularly difficult for girls in smaller places. This article raises questions about the ways in which gender gaps vary across different places and the varying effects of minority status.	[Lay, J.

Research has found associations between personality traits and partisanship in the United States. However, there is solid evidence of gender differences in personality traits, and past studies have not yet considered whether personality-partisanship relationship might be gender-differentiated. This study finds that with the increase of agreeableness, women tend to be Republicans, but men tend to be Democrats. Furthermore, as openness to experience increases, women are more likely to be strong partisans, but men are more likely to be independents or leaning partisans. To sum up, this study provides evidence that the effects of the Big Five personality traits on party identification vary by gender and suggests that it is wrong to assume that the Big Five personality traits have the same impacts on male and female party identification.

J	Rose, D				Rose, Deondra			Keys That Jingle and Fold: Federal Student Aid and the Expansion of Educational Opportunity for Black Women	JOURNAL OF WOMEN POLITICS & POLICY			English	Article						Higher education policy; educational attainment; financial aid; gender; women; race; African Americans	COLLEGE ENROLLMENT; ETHNIC-DIFFERENCES; SEX-DIFFERENCES; UNITED-STATES; FINANCIAL-AID; ATTAINMENT; POLICY; PARTICIPATION; INTELLIGENCE; ACHIEVEMENT	Since the mid-20th century, the United States has seen a dramatic increase in Black women's educational attainment. Given Black women's status as double minorities and their disproportionate representation among low-income Americans, this trend has important implications for equal opportunity in the United States. While scholars recognize higher education as a central determinant of socioeconomic well-being and political engagement, we have yet to consider the role that federal higher education policies have played in expanding Black women's access to college degrees. This article examines the extent to which student aid programs have supported Black women's educational pursuits and influenced their educational attainment. I find that financial aid usage is associated with greater educational attainment and is perceived by Black women as significantly expanding educational opportunity.

Contemporary research shows that this time period marked an important demographic shift in the composition of homeless individuals in the United States, as women, children, and families comprised a larger portion of homeless populations. Using Schneider and Ingram's (1993; 1997) Degenerative Policy Design, I used logistic regression and predicted probabilities to analyze federal congressional bills on homelessness during a 10-year period from 1977 to 1988. Results indicate that bills targeting homeless women, children, and families increased over time, but there was substantive policy action for these groups. This aligns with Schneider and Ingram's theory that groups like homeless women, who are constructed as dependent and needy but politically powerless, garner congressional elite sympathy but no monetary resources at the national level.

The effects of aerobic and resistance exercise on executive functioning was examined in 68 women over 50years of age. Participants completed the Tower of London and Benton Controlled Oral Word Association tests. Findings indicated that individuals participating in both aerobic and resistance exercises performed significantly better than individuals not participating in exercise. Individuals who were participating in both aerobic and resistance exercises did not perform disproportionately better. Thus the form of exercise appears to be less important than engaging in some form of exercise.

Roughly two-thirds of caregivers were women, and demographic characteristics differed among men and women caregivers. Women caregivers reported significantly more mentally and physically unhealthy days than men, but there were no differences between men and women in general health or life satisfaction. Men were significantly more likely to report that they rarely or never received social support. Despite this, the effect of social support on HRQOL was stronger in men than in women. Implications of these findings for caregiver support programs are discussed.

This article explores influences on the retirement decision making of older women workers in Ireland. It is based on a case study of 57 interviews with women in the Irish civil service exploring work-life decision making. It finds that retirement choices vary according to initial socioeconomic resources and/or life-course trajectories and are particularly affected by gendered caring norms, employment policy, job tenure, and place in organizational hierarchies. Those women with interrupted careers and low pay have fewer choices around retirement timing.

JOURNAL OF WOMEN & AGING			English	Article						Aging; body image; depression; social engagement; women	LIFE-SPAN; PHYSICAL APPEARANCE; EATING-DISORDERS; MENTAL-HEALTH; OLDER WOMEN; DISSATISFACTION; WEIGHT; GENDER; OBJECTIFICATION; SATISFACTION	Maintaining an active and engaged social life is a critical component of aging well, and women are generally more socially active than men. However, as women age their self-perceptions of their bodies may reduce social behaviors and consequently, increase depressive symptoms. Because little is known about how body image is associated with social engagement and depressive symptoms among aging women, four aspects of body image: satisfaction with cosmetic features, body function, physical appearance, and weight were assessed among women aged 65 and older (n=123). Regression analyses indicated that cosmetic appearance, body function, and physical appearance were associated with depressive symptoms, whereas satisfaction with weight was unrelated. Further, both greater satisfaction with cosmetic features and body function were associated with higher levels of social engagement, and social engagement mediated the association between these aspects of body satisfaction and depressive symptoms. The findings indicate that specific age-relevant aspects of body satisfaction are linked to social behavior and depression among aging women, and reduced body satisfaction may lead to lower social engagement, and consequently aging women's health and well-being may be diminished.

Postretirement housing choices of single Baby Boomer women	JOURNAL OF WOMEN & AGING			English	Article						Baby Boomers; housing; intentions; retirement; theory of planned behavior	PLANNED BEHAVIOR; RETIREMENT	Single women of the Baby Boomer generation are often financially disadvantaged in the retirement planning process due to their lower accumulated savings compared to male retirees. This disadvantage impacts significant consumption decisions such as postretirement housing choices. This study uses the theory of planned behavior to examine how certainty in intentions influences preparing and planning for postretirement housing. A typology of single Baby Boomer women is developed based on their financial, demographic, and psychological circumstances. Each segment likely requires different informational strategies and financial services to foster proactive planning for retirement. Significant implications exist for social policy and the financial services sector.

Women aged 50-55years more frequently exhibited hot flushes and vaginal dryness. Although premenopausal women were 1.5 times more likely to experience irritability, perimenopausal women were more likely to experience hot flushes, physical and mental irritability, sexual problems, vaginal dryness, and joint and muscular discomfort.

The data are based on qualitative research that was conducted in Quebec, Canada with 83 elderly women from different ethnocultural backgrounds (Arab, African, Haitian, Japanese, Chinese, Portuguese, Romanian, etc.). The results on how such immigrant women deal with material conditions of existence such as deskilling, aging alone, being more economically independent, and the combined effects of liberation from social and family norms associated with age and gender in the light of the migration route, will be presented. For the majority, migration opened up possibilities for personal development and self-affirmation. The findings demonstrated the relevance of the intersectional approach in understanding the complexity and social conditionings of women's experiences of aging.

The 2000-2006 waves of Health and Retirement Study (HRS) data, the initial years of the continuing upward trajectory, were used to test the effects of receipt of Social Security retirement benefits on older women's employment. The models tested: (a) the effect of receipt of Social Security retirement benefits on whether employed; and (b) for women receiving Social Security retirement benefits, the effect of age elected receipt of benefits on whether employed. Both models included the effects of human capital characteristics and income sources. Receipt of Social Security benefits, pension income, and current age reduced the likelihood of employment; while educational level, good to excellent health, and nonmarried marital status increased the likelihood of employment. The older the woman was when she elected Social Security benefits, the more likely she was to be employed.

Attitudes of Mexican-born womenliving in Mexico City and in East LAwere more similar to each other than those of U.S.-born women. Most caregivers reported a preference for family care and had negative views of institutional care. In addition, despite the negative views about nursing homes, some caregivers expressed a willingness to seek nursing-home care for themselves so as to avoid burdening their children in the future. Findings lend support to the persistence of Mexican cultural values in this sample of Mexican-origin caregiving women, regardless of where they were born.

While secular feminists believe that escalating authoritarianism and Islamic revivalism threaten gender equality and the gains of the women's rights movement, Islamist women contest the western/secular ideal of gender equality on account of its being antithetical to the Islamic canon. The mutual marginalization by feminists and Islamists, mainly fueled by partisan politics, harms the much needed solidarity among women's groups to solve the problems women face in Turkey, such as violence and unequal political participation. Moreover, this polarization has the harmful effect of reinforcing patriarchy: men, therefore face no challenges and simply continue to remain the sole producers and controllers of socio-political policies and epistemic resources. Hence, there seems to be a pressing need for secular feminists and Islamists to start a dialogue and focus on problems and issues they share in common, so as to seek urgent solutions to them. This article inquires into the viability of such an alliance through the proliferation of deliberative platforms where civil society organizations can meet at a safe distance from partisan politics and enter productive dialogue and generate policies to resolve the crucial problems women are facing in Turkey.

J	Kang, JS				Kang, Jean S.			Evaluating Labor Force Participation of Women in Japan and Korea: Developments and Future Prospects	ASIAN JOURNAL OF WOMENS STUDIES			English	Article						Gender disparity; female labor force participation; human capital; labor force	EAST-ASIA; CAPITALISM	The economic competitiveness of a nation in the 21(st) century requires human talent, which has become essential for areas such as research, development, execution of innovative ideas, technology, and value creation. In this respect, nations face a fundamental challenge of both attracting and retaining talented individuals to secure their economic growth. Both Japan and the Republic of Korea (Korea) are nations in dire need of human talent. Although industries in both countries are mainly focused on manufacturing and services, their working population is aging. Rather than luring human capital from across borders, however, both nations must focus primarily on incorporating more women into the workforce; while the number of highly educated women has significantly risen over the last several years, such growth has failed to contribute to an overall enhancement in the labor participation of women. On the whole, the utilization of female labor is an important factor when considering future prospects of economic growth for Japan and Korea. While Japan has successfully increased female labor participation across all age groups over the last several years, including that of women in their prime working ages, Korea has also witnessed higher numbers of women in the workforce. This is so despite the continuous trend of women leaving the workforce during their prime working years. Hence, the primary task here is to compare and contrast policy initiatives from the two countries and identify those that have been relatively successful from those that have proven to be less so. This study seeks to examine the recent efforts made by the governments of both Japan and Korea to acknowledge and promote female participation in the workforce; in doing so, it explores the multi-fold blockades that women still face at present while entering into and advancing in their careers, and propose potential methods for improving things in the future.

J	Dewi, KH				Dewi, Kurniawati Hastuti			Piety and Sexuality in a Public Sphere: Experiences of Javanese Muslim Women's Political Leadership	ASIAN JOURNAL OF WOMENS STUDIES			English	Article						Muslim women; Javanese; political leader; piety; sexuality; public sphere	SOUTHEAST-ASIA; FEMALE LEADERSHIP; INDONESIA; ISLAM	Familial ties, political dynasties and moral capital are some factors previously believed to explain female leadership in Asia. However, these are no longer sufficient to understand the rise of Muslim women in Indonesian politics, surrounded by the third wave of Islamization and globalization in the 21(st) century. This paper analyses competing ideas of Islamic piety and sexuality behind the rise of Muslim women in Indonesian local politics. It explores the stories of four female Javanese Muslim political leaders in using ideas of gender, piety and sexuality in private life and as political strategy. This paper reveals that the idea of Islamic piety, such as wearing the veil to show modesty within the increasing engagement of Indonesian society with Islamization has been prominent. Donning the veil not only signifies their Islamic modernity, it also provides comfortable spaces for manoeuvre in the public sphere. The discourses and practices of sexuality focusing on heterosexual norms have been predominant in shaping societal expectations and are used in political campaigns. This paper sees that the gender normative standard that stipulates appropriate positions and roles of women and men in Javanese society and politics has changed, in favor of greater participation by Muslim women in the public sphere.

Specifically, we investigate the kinds of opportunities and challenges regarding the issue of quotas, using the case of municipal council elections in Korea. Strongly enforced quotas in the proportional representation tier of the mixed electoral system have indeed worked favorably for women's representation in local elections since the adoption of the quota law. Yet, we also note two distinct factors that challenge quotas at the local level in the country. First, party leaders initially agree to the idea of quotas to gain public recognition, but may lack commitment and show resistance when it comes to their actual implementation. Further, the general public consensus that favors reforms in order to bar party involvement in local politics as a way to achieve grassroots democracy, may place quotas at risk, as current laws require mandatory quota implementation in the parties' candidate lists. We end our paper by highlighting the importance of grassroots democracy and that the key to achieve this goal is not only to guarantee transparency in the candidate nomination process, but also to ensure that parties commit to quota implementation.

J	Brownstein, MK				Brownstein, Megumu Kimoto			Evidence-based Advocacy in Action: Improving Access to Public Housing for Single Parents and their Children in Singapore	ASIAN JOURNAL OF WOMENS STUDIES			English	Article						Single mothers; housing; advocacy; public policies; gender equality		This case study on the Association of Women for Action and Research (AWARE) in Singapore relates a simple and powerful tenet of social justice; all children deserve government and social support regardless of their parents' marital status. Despite single parenthood becoming increasingly common, some single mothers and their children in Singapore face numerous challenges, such as finding suitable housing. Significant factors regarding this may be attributed to the housing policies and regulations that reward traditional families and underserve other forms of family structures. While more than 80 percent of Singapore's population enjoy access to public housing, unwed mothers seem to be systematically excluded from this entitlement until they reach the age of 35, in addition to other welfare and tax benefits that are consistently awarded to traditional families. Divorced single mothers also often experience poor housing situations and sometimes homelessness, apparently due to excessively stringent eligibility criteria. To address these issues, AWARE conducted evidence-based advocacy using a multi-actor and multi-level approach. The method, commitment, and coordination that AWARE has demonstrated may indeed serve as a blueprint for other organizations seeking to assist deserving single parents and their dependents.

Despite laws, policies, and constitutional guarantees for equal rights for women, there is considerable divergence between legal provisions that exist in theory and what happens in reality. Prior to the enactment of the Domestic Violence (Prevention and Protection) Act in 2010, the legal framework failed to provide any effective remedy for victims of domestic violence. In light of the major shortcomings of the earlier legal framework, civil society and women's rights organizations were engaged in advocacy efforts and demanded separate legislation to combat domestic violence. My organization, Bangladesh National Women Lawyer's Association (BNWLA), was one of the leading ones in this advocacy effort, as we had firsthand experience in providing legal aid to women and children who were subjected to violence. I have been actively involved in this process and, in this paper, I share my experiences of this successful advocacy effort.

Each addresses issues arising through collective expressions of protest. The Women's March on Washington, organized on the twin principles of intersectionality and inclusion, acted as a flashpoint for the generation of emergent spaces to do politics differently. In the search for solidarity, tensions within groups and among individuals shaped the way in which resistance and protests were responded to and organized. The authors in this collection take up themes of intersectionality and inclusion/exclusion via politicizing the personal, contesting the state, and challenging simplistic notions of unity in solidarity.

J	Gokariksel, B; Smith, S				Gokariksel, Banu; Smith, Sara			Intersectional feminism beyond US flag hijab and pussy hats in Trump's America	GENDER PLACE AND CULTURE			English	Article						Intersectionality; feminism; women's marches; political symbols; Trump; white masculinity	GEOPOLITICS; GEOGRAPHY; RELIGION; BODIES; LIFE	Since Trump came to power, he has undertaken a series of executive actions meant to threaten and terrorize a multitude of others': immigrants, Muslims, women, African Americans, Native Americans, transgender people. The defensively aggressive strategies of deportation, walls, and internal violence aim to define who belongs within the U.S. national territory and protect a threatened white masculinity which is portrayed as both victim and victor. Women and allies have been at the forefront of voicing opposition to Trumpism by organizing one of the largest marches in U.S. history on the day after inauguration and continue to resist through strikes, demonstrations, and other actions. They are raising their voices against the walls, hatred, and deportations embedded in the global turn to the right and attempting to embrace an intersectional feminism that recognizes racial, ethnic, religious, class, and other differences. Yet, in the protest signs and the embodied experience of the 21 January march itself, there were also spiraling redefinitions of what it means to be woman, what it means to be American,' and whether that is an aspirational goal or the terms of nationalist exclusion, settler colonialism, and imperial feminism. Intersectional feminism does not come easily and its challenges are manifest in some of the iconic symbols of the women's movement - from the Muslim Woman in the U.S. flag hijab to pink pussy hats. We find spaces of protest fraught but crucial sites of for forging forms of solidarity that are radical in their feminist formulations.

In particular, we highlight the concerns that women of color raised regarding the whiteness' of the marches and the lack of reciprocity that they often experience when participating in interracial coalitions with white allies.' Drawing upon Judith Butler's recent work on the performative politics of assembly and Chantal Mouffe's conception of radical democracy, we argue that concerted bodily action and the enactment of collective political subjectivities are contested processes in which bodies-in-alliance' may march together but do not necessarily act in conformity. It is therefore crucial to cultivate agonistic spaces within solidarity movements in which adversarial conflicts among allies' can emerge if such movements are to remain committed to radical democratic politics. We explore these issues further by discussing our own conflicting experiences at the rally to support the Women's March in Victoria, British Columbia.

J	Graddy-Lovelace, G				Graddy-Lovelace, Garrett			Latent alliances: the Women's March and agrarian feminism as opportunities of and for political ecology	GENDER PLACE AND CULTURE			English	Article						Feminist political ecology; agrarian movements; anti-racism; intersectional alliances; La Via Campesina	HUMAN-RIGHTS; GENDER; AGRICULTURE; CAMPESINA; RACE; LA	On 21 January 2017, the day after a bitterly contested presidential inauguration, nearly 5 million women and men marched and protested in 673 places across the globe - under the banner of the Women's March. The March exceeded and expanded expectations on many levels, from organizational projections to media classifications to scholarly analysis. One aspect of the March - and its ongoing repercussions - that has eluded attention is its latent links to and alliances with women-led agrarian movements underway in the United States and internationally. Rendering the March merely urban does a disservice to the subtle ways agricultural politics and even agrarian resistance permeated its political messages. I argue that a feminist political ecology analysis - particularly a postcolonial, intersectional one rooted in anti-racism and anti-classism and following the lead of Black agrarian womanism - helps elucidate the latent alignments between and among the Women's March and transnational women-led agrarian movements, such as those of La Via Campesina. As such, the burgeoning field of feminist political ecology is well-equipped to help connect the applied intersectional visions at work in the Women's March with those of agrarian feminist movements, even as this task provides an important intellectual opportunity for political ecology itself.

We created a sea of pink!'. On 19 January 2017, one day before the Women's March on Washington, it is estimated that a hundred thousand Pussyhats had been made and distributed. The hats were part of an initiative called the Pussyhat Project. Calling upon knitters, crocheters, sewists and feminists, the Pussyhat Project aims to mobilize the handmade for the purposes of increasing the visibility, representation, and awareness of women's rights in general, and of women's rights activists at the Women's March on Washington in particular. Since its inception, the Project has received numerous accolades and criticisms in mainstream and social media. In particular, the Project has been lauded as an example of craft activism or craftivism. This article explores the Pussyhat Project in relation to craft activism and contemporary craft in the Global North, particularly in terms of gender, race, class, and space. This article provides a critical context for examining the Pussyhat Project, a context that is largely missing in both celebrations and criticisms of Pussyhats thus far. Such contextualizing broadens discussions about the Pussyhat Project. In doing so, it contributes to on-going considerations about how to engage craft as a tool of substantive, feminist social change.

Yet the organization and effects of events surrounding the March seemed to be invoking conventional understandings of what counts as femininity. We conceptualized this tension as a practice associated with Foucault's ideas about the politics of purification. We look at the construction of pure bodies to the detriment of unpure ones in three contested sites of the March: the erasure of Indigenous women and women of colour within the Women's March on Washington-Vancouver organizing group, the use of the PussyHat to symbolize unity of all women, and the reclamation of the nasty woman meme. From our critical reflection on these productive processes, we suggest that new spaces have emerged as an effect of these acts that possess the potential to produce alternative notions of femininity that can challenge conventional, hegemonic ones.

Through a black feminist reading of resistance, self-care, and solidarity, we explore this moment of political emergence and connect it to a broader arc of resistance, passed and felt through black women's bodies and geographies. We employ a feminist narrative empiricism to blend ethnographic retelling with fiction and use the composite character of Angela to highlight the textures and tensions of mobilizing resistance. This narrative, set against the backdrop of the Women's March, follows Angela, a middle-aged black woman, as she moves through modes of resistance, persistence, and desistance, and as she connects movements spurred by the recent U.S. presidential election to those entangled with past and everyday spaces of resistance traversed by black women. By using our research on race and housing, social mobility, mental health, and incarceration in Central Texas to talk-story to the Women's March, we historicize the political present and trace the emotions, motivations and frustrations we see transpiring across longstanding and emergent spaces of resistance and solidarity. Through this account, we aim to narratively provoke reflection, and generate modes of reconsidering and remembering that can advance intersectional solidarities.

This article contains the entirety of her speech which provides some autobiographical details about the author's journey to fully accept her transgender identity and her coming to clarity that taking on a more activist role was an important step in healing from the pain imposed by society for being transgender. In addition, the article provides both the theoretical context for that speech as well as a basic description of the march itself and the venue for the speeches.

There are very limited studies specifically focusing on this population. The findings synthesized domestic helpers' characteristics, acknowledged their contributions to elder care in China, and showed multiple challenges facing them, such as issues related to their physical health and emotional well-being, lack of legal rights protection, difficulties of adapting life in the host city, lack of training, and risk of abuse and sexual harassment. Our findings support the need for developing training and educational programs about legal rights protection and cultural competency for domestic helpers and the need to promote domestic helpers' access to health care and social welfare and opportunities for career advancement, and provide respectful working conditions.

It considers the ways in which retirement can enable liberation from patriarchal kinship structures and embodied values of respectability. The aim is to illuminate how deep, embodied values can become conscious and explicit during precarious life situations and transitional phases. The relation between the Swedish welfare state, an I-we balance, and gender equity values are illuminated. These analytical dimensions support the analysis by providing insights into the ways in which individuals embody and use cultural and social structures when they aim to manage unpredictability and to create change toward self-actualization.

Internationally, gender inequalities in aging are still relatively invisible within both government policy and everyday life for particular groups of women. This article explores the concept of women growing older soloby which we mean women who find themselves nonpartnered and aging without children as they move into later life. We report on the findings from a mixed-methods survey of 76 solo women in the UK aged 50years and over, used to provide a broader overview of the issues and challenges they face as they move into later life. Qualitative data from the survey captured respondents' perspectives about the links between their relationships status and well-being in later life and highlighted specific cumulative disadvantages emerging for some women as a result of their solo lifestyles. We discuss two key themes that were identified, solo-loneliness and meaningful futures, in conjunction with the relevant literature and make suggestions for future research within gender and aging studies that could enhance more positive approaches to solo lifestyles.

Twenty-four older women (mean age 66.4years old) attended dance sessions for threemonths. Pretest/posttests were completed using the Postural Stability Test, the Limits of Stability Test, and the Fall Risk Test M-CTSIB. Results showed the Limits of Stability Test was significantly higher (17.5%) after dance classes.

Gender gap in preferences for defined contribution pensions in Japan	JOURNAL OF WOMEN & AGING			English	Article						Defined contribution pensions; gender gap; Japanese employees; Prince Charming Syndrome	RISK-TAKING; RETIREMENT; BEHAVIOR; CHANCE; SKILL; WILL	Using survey data collected by the Japan Institute of Life Insurance in 2002, this study finds that a significant gender gap existed in defined contribution (DC) pension knowledge among workers employed at small- to medium-sized private firms in Japan. Even with similar DC knowledge, however, men and women reveal different preferences for DC pensions, indicating that their perceptional responses may widely differ from actual behaviors. Apart from the knowledge gap, the result shows evidence of the Prince Charming Syndrome among female employees as a significant source of the gender gap in DC participation rates. Among corporate pension-covered employees, the gender difference in the efficacy of DC portability is a more significant gap-generating factor. DC tax advantage is particularly favored by pension-covered female employees over male counterparts, reducing the DC preference gap. No similar evidence is found for employees with no corporate pension coverage.

J	Johnson, KM				Johnson, Katherine M.			Single, straight, wants kids: media framing of single, heterosexual fatherhood via assisted reproduction	JOURNAL OF GENDER STUDIES			English	Article						Single fatherhood; media; culture; assisted reproduction; US	PARENTS MATTER; UNITED-STATES; GAY MEN; MASCULINITY; FAMILIES; GENDER; WORK; INVOLVEMENT; TRANSITION; POLITICS	The new reproductive technologies have made possible various postmodern family forms. I highlight an emerging form that has received little attention: single fathers by choice (SFCs), created by single men using egg donation and surrogacy. I focus on heterosexual SFCs, which have been largely ignored in the scholarly literature even as gay and lesbian parenthood have increasingly become topics of feminist inquiry. This type of fatherhood raises several important questions for gender and family scholars about the traditional' family, the relationship between masculinity and fatherhood, and men's own desires for parenthood without a female partner. I analyze US media framing to explore cultural sense-making of SFCs. While media framing cannot tell us about men's lived experiences as intentional single fathers, it does point to larger discourses that potentially impact these men as they engage in non-normative fathering. I identify three core themes within the media frames: (1) viewing men and women as similar, but ultimately different, (2) addressing the tension between bachelorhood and fatherhood, and (3) representing the gender of paternal desire in multiple, conflicting ways. Overall, I argue that further investigations of SFCs can illuminate issues about men's desires for children and agency in becoming fathers.

J	Liong, M				Liong, Mario			Sacrifice for the family: representation and practice of stay-at-home fathers in the intersection of masculinity and class in Hong Kong	JOURNAL OF GENDER STUDIES			English	Article						Stay-at-home fathers; family; gender; class; media representation; capital; reflexivity	SINGLE-FATHER; REFLEXIVITY; HABITUS; GENDER; CULTURE; WORK; HOUSEWIVES; SOCIOLOGY; MOTHERS; WOMEN	With changing socio-economic conditions, some men choose to become stay-at-home fathers in Hong Kong. Although they constitute only about .5% of the total male population, they have captured widespread media attention in recent years. This paper is an exploratory study on the gender representation of stay-at-home fathers in newspapers, and their identity and practice in real life in relation to the construction of masculinity in the Asian context, with particular focus on the intersection of masculinity and social class. Although stay-at-home fathers have given up their traditional breadwinner role, the media continue to portray them in terms of conventional masculinity. Contrary to the findings in Western society, this paper, which is based on Bourdieu's practice theory, reports that middle-class men in Hong Kong with social and cultural capital are less reflexive in their gender habitus to accept their carer identity, whereas working-class fathers, who lack the appropriate capital to resume their provider status, define themselves as carers who are responsible to the family. As the identity of provider is still central to men, the emergence of this new fatherhood is only a refashioning of the traditional role of fathers and thus does not challenge the existing gender structure.

J	Elaman-Garner, S				Elaman-Garner, Sevinc			The image of "ideal' Turkish womanhood? a Bakhtinian approach to Halide Edib Advar's Raik'in Annesi (Raik's Mother) (1909)	JOURNAL OF GENDER STUDIES			English	Article						Halide Edib Advar; Raik'in Annesi; Bakhtin; Westernisation; gender; "ideal' Turkish woman		Critics often read Halide Edib Advar's Raik'in Annesi (Raik's Mother, 1909) as an affirmation of the author's vision of ideal' womanhood, one which is aligned with the visions of reformers involved in the projects of Turkish nationalism and modernisation. This article presents an analysis of the novel that both incorporates and goes beyond such accounts. Instead of focusing on depictions of the heroine (Refika) as signs of female objectification or as reflections of Advar's views on the woman question, the analysis focuses on the dialogic properties of the text in order to attend to the ways in which the heroine is presented as the locus of an ongoing conflict between her own aspirations for independence and the various opinions and judgements about her that are set within the discursive boundaries of ideal' womanhood. The analysis draws on Bakhtin's theory of dialogism (and concepts related to it, in particular authoritative and internally persuasive discourse' and the notion of internal dialogue) and examines the tension between the hegemonic discourse that asserts the role of ideal' wife-mother and the dissenting voices in the text that provide insight into the heroine's experiences and struggles for autonomy. In doing so, we can develop a sense of the polyvocal, dialogic and inconsistent depiction of the heroine while drawing out the texts' critiques of the conventions of womanhood and marriage and their effects on women. By analysing such contradictory depictions of Refika, the article aims to draw attention to the way in which the text problematises the image of ideal' womanhood, whilst offering reflection on the novel's concluding commentary on the woman struggle for agency and freedom.

J	Pichler, P				Pichler, Pia			'You are stupid, you are cupid': playful polyphony as a resource for affectionate expression in the talk of a young London couple	GENDER AND LANGUAGE			English	Article						COUPLES' TALK; INTIMATE RELATIONSHIPS; AFFECTIONATE PRACTICE; VOICE PLAY; HETEROGLOSSIA; PLAYFUL INSULTS; CODE-SWITCHING; SYLHETI; BABY VOICE	LOVE; GENDER; WOMEN; POWER; MEN	Whereas language and gender studies' explorations of couples' talk have tended to focus on collaborative versus competitive conversational style, social psychological work on couples' intimate relationships has long been driven by an interest in expressions of affection. This paper aims to show that linguistic discourse analysis can make a significant contribution to our understanding of how affection is expressed in intimate relationships. The paper focuses on the playful switching of frames, voices, codes and personas which emerges as central to the affectionate practice in the spontaneous talk of a young multicultural London couple. It argues that quantitative interview studies based on an a priori understanding of affection are unable to capture many of the idiosyncratic and creative ways in which speakers express their affection for one another in their intimate talk.

J	Rajilic, S				Rajilic, Simone			Is Serbian becoming Croatian? Nationalist counter-reactions to feminist linguistics in Serbia	GENDER AND LANGUAGE			English	Article						FEMINIST LINGUISTICS IN SERBIA; (NON-)SEXIST LANGUAGE; NATIONALIST LANGUAGE POLICY IN THE FORMER YUGOSLAVIA; INTERFERENCES OF NATIONALISM AND ANTI-FEMINISM IN SERBIA		The paper investigates how nationalism (which flourished since the disintegration of Yugoslavia) and Serbo-Croatian language unity is instrumentalised to block the debates on sexist language in Serbia. Serbian feminists criticise current language practices as being sexist by making women linguistically invisible or rather exclusively visible in stereotypical contexts with only little social prestige. They challenge the supposedly gender-neutrality of so called 'masculine generics' and demand a consistent use of gender-specific forms for females. On the contrary, traditional Serbian linguists deny any discriminatory language patterns claiming that nouns for males can be used for females as well because of the 'nature' or 'spirit' of the Serbian language. Beside those arguments known from similar debates which have been held for other languages, the Serbian anti-feminist discourses on gender and language are even specific: Several gender-specific female nouns are found not to be Serbian but Croatian and should therefore not be used in Serbia. The proposals of feminists for non-sexist language are even accused of endangering Serbian national integrity by turning the Serbian language into Croatian - ignoring the fact that Serbian and Croatian share most of their lexicon being successor languages of Serbo-Croatian.

J	Lopez, L; Gonzalez, RCL				Lopez, Lucrezia; Lois Gonzalez, Ruben Camilo			The voices of female pilgrims in medieval wills. The Jacobean devotion in Apulia (Italy)	GENDER PLACE AND CULTURE			English	Article						Female pilgrims; rituals; wills; bequests; manifestations of the worship of St; James; Apulia (Italy)	WOMEN; CRUSADE	The main topic of this study is to contribute to the study of female sacred mobility in the Middle Ages by proposing a new approach for the analysis of historical sources (wills and bequests), combining quantitative and qualitative methodology. We have set three aims: (1) Reinforcing the female presence within historical documents through their empirical analysis; (2) Reflecting upon female participation in the public sphere; (3) Investigating women's agency in religious terms. Concerning the geographical context of the research, the historical sources have been retrieved from the Historical Archives of the Italian Region of Apulia (Italy); where we have studied the above mentioned topics in relation to the devotion to St. James (Spain). The first part of the article introduces female mobility to the city of Santiago de Compostela; then, it moves to the forms of devotion to the Apostle St. James the Greater and female pilgrims in Apulia. The present empirical study has the differential to propose a transversal interpretation of the selected historical texts according to the following criteria: (1) Devotion to the Apostle St. James the Greater (2) Female devotion. As well as reinforcing the use of these historical documents to investigate female social behaviour, the research contributes to the study of the female role within the geography of pilgrimage in the following terms: sacred mobility; territorial history and experiential and devotional value.

It explores how non-combatant women in the army retrospectively narrate stressful situations that happened during their military service. Using arts-based methods, we examine how they derive meaning from their experiences in a masculine, military environment, affected by ongoing conflict. This article analyzes twenty images drawn by Israeli women who served in the army in the previous 2-4years. The women drew a stressful event from their military service, explained the image, and elaborated on how they coped with the situation. A content analysis of the pictures and the narratives produced three themes: the responsibility for others in life threatening situations, the military as a first professional work experience and the interaction between military and gender hierarchies. In general, women soldiers experienced the army as complex as they encountered their first adult work space in which they learned responsibility and skills of the adults' world'. However, they were also exposed to a rigid hierarchy and to stressful security situations typical of army contexts. While non-combat women soldiers were allegedly protected from the violence of the army, they are also indirectly exposed to the danger inherent in an army context. This analysis goes beyond the hero narrative, and moves into taboo territories of young women's narratives and experiences in the military.

Wandering intellectuals: establishing a research agenda on gender, walking, and thinking	GENDER PLACE AND CULTURE			English	Article						Walking; intellectual work; gender; expectations; research agenda	PHYSICAL-ACTIVITY; URBAN WALKING; ADULTS; WOMEN; LANDSCAPE; ACADEMICS; CHILDREN; OUTCOMES; DISEASE; STRESS	Building on a study of three women who practice walking-for-thinking as a part of their intellectual work, the analysis identifies potential themes for a future research agenda on gender, walking, and thinking. A particular focus is the subtle, daily, management of gendered expectations and ways in which walking, for these women, is a contribution to such management. We name this walking away from expectations' and identify three themes: walking away from others' gaze, walking away from restlessness and domestic responsibility, and walking away as belonging. Walking emerges as a skilful way of creating the conditions to do one's intellectual work and manage gendered expectations. Further, the meanings of silences about gender in the context of intellectual work and walking is discussed and questions for future research agenda are suggested.

This introductory essay draws out linkages across these papers, and to several themes in feminist geography. Combined, the four papers in the themed section offer new pathways for feminist geographers to consider. The authors connect the intimate and the global, the personal and the geopolitical, and offer critical insights into how feminist geographers might unpack entangled inequalities that give rise to distinct experiences of violence. Through their disparate studies, the authors also destabilize the assumptions mapped onto gendered bodies, particularly those that rely on racist, sexist, and classist representations of culture' and community' to describe gendered vulnerability. Subsequently, their analyses reveal how these assumptions simultaneously work to erase or ignore structural inequalities of capitalism or the state, which frame, contribute to and perpetuate violence against vulnerable bodies and geographies. They collectively underscore the epistemological, methodological and ontological possibilities of corporeal geographies particularly when tasked with intellectually analyzing both exceptional and everyday experiences of violence.

I examine structural processes that shape women's experiences of and vulnerability to intimate violence. My analysis complicates culturalist narratives, but engages critically with culture as one context within which violence is embedded. Drawing on field research within Muslim communities in Hyderabad, India, I discuss the complexities of interwoven experiences of structural, state, and intimate gender violence. I draw attention to how anti-violence organizations working in marginalized communities theorize these complexities, and practices of what I am calling plural resistance,' which these organizations enact through equally complex responses to such violences. Plural resistance describes community-based strategies that simultaneously reject both gender violence and other forms of systemic violence, such as poverty born of uneven development. Embodied resistance to gender violence provides a critical lens for understanding articulations between regional patriarchies, exclusionary state practices, uneven development, and Islamophobia.

J	Faria, C				Faria, Caroline			Towards a countertopography of intimate war: contouring violence and resistance in a South Sudanese diaspora	GENDER PLACE AND CULTURE			English	Article						Feminist political geography; intimate geopolitics; gender; refugees; South Sudan	DOMESTIC VIOLENCE; FEMINIST GEOPOLITICS; MILITARY; SECURITY; CAMBODIA; BODIES; WOMEN; FEAR	Recent feminist geographic scholarship insists we rethink domestic violence as intimate war'. Using this concept I analyze narratives of violence and resistance articulated by U.S.-resettled South Sudanese women and collected in the wake of a fatal incidence of domestic violence in 2005. One of a spate of intimate partner murders that shook the community at this time, this tragic event spurred debates about shifting gender norms, the stresses and opportunities of life in the diaspora, and the irradicable legacies of war. Bringing Pain and Staeheli's intimacy-geopolitics' to bear on this particularly violent, momentary and publicized aggression, I situate it within a more complex, quotidian, and dynamic terrain of power. In line with feminist political geography, this analysis complicates scalar distinctions of body, home and nation-state, demonstrating the common foundations of private', domestic and public', state-sanctioned violences. Inspired by Katz's countertopographical approach, I extend our understanding of intimate war by contouring moments of violence and resistance in a diasporic context, over the lifecourse of refugee women, and across their sites of flight, displacement and resettlement. Tracing the mobilities of intimate war in this way productively reveals the spatial and temporal, as well as scalar, folds that may form part of its foundation.

We see this process of data creation, self-awareness and action as inherently linked to the native concept territorio cuerpo-tierra, the landscape of bodies-lands. The concept erases Western notions separating bodies and land and helps to decenter the public-private divide, which is an important obstacle to eliminating violence against women. Drawing on data from our work with Mexican women in the, U.S. and Mexico, we illuminate the continuity of women's individual bodily experience of violence and collective spatial knowledge of community safety. We conclude that the process and outcomes of body and community mapping linking bodies and land, afford planners the prospect of engaging as partners and co-actants with community members in the goal of making places safe for women.

These social marketing messages and donor strategies mimic arguments for gender equality from the 1970s and 1980s. Rather than building on the rights-based development and best practices of the 1990s, they ignore the critical roles of political capacity and participation that the past forty years and feminist analysis of development achievements and failures have taught us are essential to taking on gender and economic inequality. Certain trends in foreign aid accountability share this silence on the importance of political capacity. In contrast, the rights-based approach to gender equality and development (RBA) is a political approach to development. We reconcile the need for aid accountability with the need for a focus on politics by outlining key political processes of the rights-based approach. The RBA is a way of doing development that is attentive to process and power. We can use the RBA not just as a guide for how to do development, but also as a way to think about processes as outcome measures. The processes that the RBA requires are processes that build capacity for marginalized women and people.

Victims, soldiers, peacemakers and caretakers: the neoliberal constitution of women in the EU's security policy	INTERNATIONAL FEMINIST JOURNAL OF POLITICS			English	Article						governmentality; EU; gender; security; neoliberal	GLOBAL CIVIL-SOCIETY; GENDER EQUALITY; NORMATIVE POWER; EUROPEAN-UNION; GOVERNMENTALITY; CONSTRUCTION; EMPOWERMENT; POLITICS; ENLARGEMENT; RESISTANCE	Feminist scholars praise and criticize the UNSC Resolution 1325 on Women, Peace and Security for its considerations of women and gender in conflicts. Poststructuralist feminists show how gender is constructed in the UN's security policies and how these constructions reproduce gendered dichotomies between women and men and representations of women as victims, part of civil society and neoliberal subjects. Although the UNSC Resolutions 1325 and 1820 are implemented by the EU, there is no literature on how the EU is taking up the UN's discourse. Scholars studying gender policies in and of the EU mainly analyze the (in)effectiveness of EU gender mainstreaming but rarely interrogate its discursive foundations. Using a governmentality perspective, I argue that on the one hand the EU produces a binary and stereotypical understanding of gender, and on the other hand constitutes women as neoliberal subjects responsible for their own well-being, ignoring broader structures of (gender) inequality and war and making gender equality solely an instrument to achieve more security and development.

J	Weiner, S				Weiner, Scott			Objectification as negotiation: reexamining the agency of targets	INTERNATIONAL FEMINIST JOURNAL OF POLITICS			English	Article						Consent; FEMEN; feminism; gender; objectification	SEXUAL OBJECTIFICATION; MUSLIM WOMEN	Why and under what conditions do individuals participate in their own physical objectification? Literature across disciplines acknowledges such conditions exist but has limited capacity to specify when and how a person might participate in her own objectification. This article argues that a target of objectification, under certain conditions, can accept objectification in pursuit of another goal. This conception is counterintuitive given that existing approaches sometimes treat the targets of objectification as lacking agency. However, by obscuring this agency such accounts further the same objectification they highlight as problematic. This article offers a positive model of objectified targets' agency. This model, called Negotiated Objectification, serves as an analytical tool that scholars can leverage in feminist academic debates over objectification. The utility of the model is illustrated using three examples: FEMEN's topless protests; the politics of the Muslim headscarf; and women's body writing in support of the Israel Defense Forces. The article concludes by considering the implications of women's agency in each case for debates over the role of agents under objectification.

I first develop a theoretical framework for understanding co-optation by separating the who and the what of co-optation: actors who embody diversity in public, political debate become the who of co-optation, as their agency is shaped by gendered and racialized processes of subject making. The what of co-optation revolves around particular conceptualizations of practices, rights and freedoms, associated in this case with gender equality, which is rendered an empty signifier in the process. I then illustrate this framework by drawing from research on the Sharia-based arbitration debate that took place in Ontario, Canada, between late 2003 and early 2006. I focus on the claims of two Canadian Muslim women activists to show that co-optation occurs as attempts to further liberation instead advance illiberal practices.

J	Mantymaki, TH				Maentymaeki, Tiina Helen			"I have always been so afraid": Fearsome Encounters in Unni Lindell's Rodhette	NORA-NORDIC JOURNAL OF FEMINIST AND GENDER RESEARCH			English	Article						Crime narrative; violence; female murderer; fear; encounter; emotion		Norwegian crime writer Unni Lindell's novel Rodhette [Red Riding Hood] (Oslo: Aschehoug & Co, 2004/2010) is a narrative about a woman whose feeling of safety transforms into a fear of violation, and how her defence against this fear takes the form of systematic violence. The novel is a rewriting of the traditional tale of "Little Red Riding Hood" and is a comment on the patriarchal premises of the most widely known version of this folktale. In the article, I discuss the representation of the female murderer as being in the grip of an affective economy based on the fear of male violence, represented in the novel by the metaphor of the "wolf", and how fear grows into a comprehensive, moral and pragmatic, murderous orientation towards the world after an experience of violence. Theoretically, I draw on affect theory and particularly Sara Ahmed's ideas about the affective politics of fear (The cultural politics of emotion. Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2014) and how this fear turns into a significant qualifier in encounters with people who are experienced as strangers (Strange encounters: Embodied others in post-coloniality. London: Routledge, 2000). Fear is treated in Lindell's novel as a psychological constriction and a tool for the construction of agency, through which the mechanisms of othering and violence are explored.

J	Axelsdottir, L; Einarsdottir, P				Axelsdottir, Laufey; Einarsdottir, Porgerdur			The Realization of Gender Quotas in Post-collapse Iceland	NORA-NORDIC JOURNAL OF FEMINIST AND GENDER RESEARCH			English	Article						Economy; Wollstonecraft dilemma; gender quota; patriarchal power relations; glass cliff	GLASS CLIFF; TOP MANAGEMENT; WOMEN; DIVERSITY	Gender quotas have become a way to increase women's participation in leading positions in economic life. Iceland enacted corporate gender quotas in 2013, requiring a minimum of 40% of each gender. These quotas were legalized after the financial collapse in 2008, which many blamed on male dominance of the economy. The focus of this paper is the timeframe of the turn to quotas, and the media discourse and parliamentary debate regarding men and women in corporate management. Van Dijk's theoretical framework of critical discourse analysis was employed to examine data from the period 2009-2015. Firstly, we studied 150 articles in three online newspapers: Morgunblaoio, Visir, and Vioskiptablaoio, written between 2009 and 2015. Secondly, we examined 132 parliamentary documents in which gender quotas were proposed and debated in 2009 and 2010. Three themes were highlighted: gender difference and opportunities during critical times; women and capability; and changed discourse. In order to shed light on the struggle for women's influence, we examine how the debate manifested the Wollstonecraft dilemma. The results show a tension between gender-neutral arguments versus arguments about women's alleged special traits and qualifications. Arguments emphasizing the importance of women's special capabilities for the well-being of society and companies' profitability were at the heart of the quota legislation, and as such proved successful. However, the findings also demonstrate the risk that female candidates are viewed as a signal of change in times of crisis. Hence, we claim that arguments matter; although women-centred arguments have contributed to gender balance within the Icelandic economy, they may also create barriers for women because they support patriarchal relations. Furthermore, the results indicate that societal difficulties call for drastic changes, and it seems as though a tailwind is needed for women to receive opportunities within the economic sector to push gender equality forward.

The ongoing debate about legalization has focused on sex workers' agency and choice, and on the role of stigma in shaping the supply of and demand for sex work. Building on the analysis advanced by contributions to this special issue, this study contends that theoretical and policy debates about sex work are dominated by false dichotomies of agency and stigma. It argues that the relationship between stigma and agency operates along a continuum of contractual arrangements that underpins a high degree of segmentation in the industry. The higher the stigma, the lower tends to be the agency. Current policies toward sex work therefore need reconsideration - especially mounting support for criminalization of clients, which, by increasing stigma, is likely to detract from the agency and the well-being of sex workers, however unintentionally.

It does so by focusing on a very stigmatized and discriminated-against population: transsexual and transgender people. We collected original data on trans people through nonrandom sampling within a study aimed at assessing gender-identity discrimination in Italy. A multivariate analysis of the determinants of falling into sex work confirms that within the trans population, pull factors- specifically, prospective income- positively affect the decision to supply sex services. Even more relevant are push factors, such as low employability and past experiences of discrimination. The resulting sex-work trap calls for policy initiatives to enhance the employability of marginalized individuals as well as an effective fight against stigma and discrimination in the labor market.

The literature and politics of sex work migration and human trafficking economies are commonly relegated to the realm that focuses on profits for criminal networks and pimps, in particular recirculating the claim that human trafficking is the third largest criminal economy after drugs and weapons. Based on ethnographic fieldwork among Nigerian sex worker migrants conducted in Benin City, Nigeria, in 2011 and 2012, this study brings together four otherwise isolated migration economies - facilitation, remittances, deportation, and rescue - and suggests that we have to examine multiple sites and relink these in order to more fully understand the complexity of sex work migration. Drawing upon literature within transnational feminist analysis, critical human trafficking studies, and migration industry research, this study seeks to broaden our current understanding of the economy of human trafficking.

ACMs are commonly construed as trafficked pornographers or (digital) prostitutes. But, the models do not identify their work as prostitution or even as sex work; nor are they trafficked. Thus, ACMs challenge common perceptions about sex work and agency, revealing a range of possible social stigmas and self-identities associated with such work. The study goes on to a comparative exploration of several forms of sex work and presents reasons for a lack of occupational mobility within the Philippines' sex industry for each form. In particular, because ACMs do not necessarily identify as sex workers, they are unwilling to move to other forms of sex work.

This article aims to fill the gap in the dearth of academic analysis of alternative representations of childbearing by examining the documentary film The Business of Being Born and the BBC TV drama series Call the Midwife. Although they are situated in disparate socio-historical contexts, both productions push against medicalization and present positive images of "natural" childbirth. Business systematically critiques medicalization of birth in the US and presents midwifery-assisted homebirth as the solution. Call counters the dogma of necessary medical attention during childbirth by showing how midwifery dominated during the mid-twentieth century in a London neighborhood. Call also portrays midwives and a physician collaboratively providing maternal care in an impoverished neighborhood. Reviewed together, Business and Call augment each other as the former reveals the contemporary struggles and solutions devised to de-medicalize birth and the latter serves as an example of how homebirths may be supported by medico-midwifery collaboration in an urban community.

This article thickens this line of inquiry by arguing that TLC uses a narrow, but decipherable, range of temporalities to leverage biomedicine's claim to childbirth. Drawing on the rhetorical concepts of chronos as narrative duration-time and kairos as interruptive moments of possibility, I argue that episodes are structured by a chronic articulation of "family completion" and "hospital biomedical duration" that conditions women to expect a kairotic interruption of selected birth plans. I conclude with implications for studying birth temporalities and rhetorically crafting women-centered birth narratives.

Even though her entry into politics was heavily indebted to her kinship ties to her father Park Jung-Hee, an authoritarian leader who led South Korea from 1963 to 1979, she has consolidated her position within the party and among Korean voters as a viable, competent politician over the last fifteen years. Analyzing Korean news reports, campaign pamphlets, and her autobiography, this study reveals that Park used stereotypes of women as problem solvers in difficult times to open doors for her political entry. During the presidential campaign in 2012, Park was adept at stressing her positive "feminine" traits, overcoming the perceived weaknesses of female politicians by emphasizing her long political credentials and strengths in diplomacy and national security issues. Park presented herself as the embodiment of both change and experience through her campaign slogan "the well-prepared female president" and the public reacted favorably to the appeal.

J	Falkof, N				Falkof, Nicky			"The devil destroyed us": Satanism and gender violence in South Africa	FEMINIST MEDIA STUDIES			English	Article						South Africa; moral panic; Satanism; murder; gender	WOMEN; NEWS	In October 2011, a young South African woman named Kirsty Theologo was set on fire and left for dead by a group of her high school contemporaries in Linmeyer, Johannesburg. The killing was defined as a "Satanist murder," leading to media, judicial, and religious interventions aimed at countering the apparent Satanic threat. This article examines press material surrounding Kirsty Theologo's death and the subsequent arrest and trial of her killers. It argues that the ongoing moral panic around Satanism in contemporary South Africa has obscured the often gendered nature of so-called satanic violence, showing the way in which the murder was instead placed within a familiar framework of Satanic panic in an act of collective displacement that elided the structural and historical contexts of acts of extreme violence perpetrated by young South African men on the bodies of young South African women.

Changes in social advertising on male violence against women in Italy	FEMINIST MEDIA STUDIES			English	Article						Gender-based violence; social advertising; Italy; masculinities; cultural innovation		This paper examines how male violence against women is represented in Italian advertisements. It focuses on the recent developments in social and commercial campaigns, showing their connection to broader changes in the public discourse on gender-based violence. The analysis builds on the assumption that effective social advertising should promote a paradigm shift to reflect the complexity of the phenomenon and encourage a different social perception of it. Gender-based violence is a symptom of the cultural order that moulds our gender identities and our intimate relationships. Only those campaigns capable of going beyond the symptoms to reveal the ingrained set of cultural norms that legitimize male violence can be effective. Today the pictures of bruised faces are so embedded in our everyday imaginary that they are almost invisible.

J	Toffoletti, K				Toffoletti, Kim			Sexy women sports fans: femininity, sexuality, and the global sport spectacle	FEMINIST MEDIA STUDIES			English	Article						Sport; women; post-feminism; fans; media	GENDER; MEDIA; REPRESENTATIONS; IMAGES	In recent years the relationship between women and sport fandom has undergone significant shifts. The rapidly changing sphere of global sport is seen to offer women newly visible roles in the global sport economy as fans, broadcasters, celebrity athletes, and media personalities. In light of calls for greater inclusivity and diversity in sport, this paper examines the emergence of new forms of "sexually empowered" female fandom, which situate women as active participants in the sporting spectacle. Whereas sexy women who followed men's sport or male athletes were once derided as "groupies," thus socially marginalised and excluded from identification with sport fan communities, I argue that the sexy sport fan has emerged in the context of post-feminism as a visible and necessary type of feminine fan identity to meet the needs of the global sport economy. This study extends feminist sport media analysis beyond its focus on how female athletes are represented whilst also contributing new insights to sport fan research by analysing how female supporters are constructed through mediated accounts in terms of gender, sexuality, and nation.

J	Nayar, KI				Nayar, Kavita Ilona			Working it: the professionalization of amateurism in digital adult entertainment	FEMINIST MEDIA STUDIES			English	Article						Professional amateur; user-generated content; gender; sex work; creative labor	POLITICAL-ECONOMY; WEB 2.0; LABOR; ERA	This article examines a sector of professional amateur work for women in the digital industry for adult entertainment known as "adult webcam modeling" (AWM). Through a selection of narratives, this paper explores the gendered meanings of AWM and the values women derive from their "amateur" sexual content creation. I draw particular attention to the complex union of professional and amateur roles and relations in the strategies women adopt to succeed in these spaces. On one level, they describe the technical skills and institutionalized knowledge needed to successfully perform professionalized duties of hosting and animating site users' sexual and emotional fantasies. Still, they do not solely view their work in professional terms, highlighting the usefulness of enacting their amateurism by performing authenticity and developing ongoing friendships with site users for succeeding in this line of work. Framing this work as reliant on both "professional" and "amateur" strategies builds ambiguity into the AWM persona, which has implications for social and historical constructions of sexuality and gender. It also demands rethinking conceptual frameworks that create dualities between professional/amateur, public/private, and commercial/authentic.

Shaping Perceptions of Sarah Palin's Charisma: Presentations of Palin in the 2008 Presidential Election	JOURNAL OF WOMEN POLITICS & POLICY			English	Article						Charisma; leadership; feminine charisma; masculine charisma; Sarah Palin; transformational leader; gender traits; charismatic leadership	GENDER STEREOTYPES; FEMALE CANDIDATES; LEADERSHIP; CAMPAIGN; WOMEN; CONSEQUENCES; VOTE; ATTRIBUTION; COVERAGE; OPINION	Research has shown that male politicians are often stereotyped as stronger leaders than female politicians. This research, however, has taken a fairly narrow view of leadership. In the business organization literature, a leadership style called charismatic leadership is treated as a multidimensional concept, with feminine and masculine attributes. While scholarship has considered factors that shape perceptions of charisma, it has not looked at the effect of media presentations. This question became especially timely during the 2008 election. Using data from an experiment with voters in Los Angeles County, we show how media presentations impact the feminine and masculine components of Sarah Palin's charisma. In our analysis, we show that media presentations that highlight stereotypically feminine traits increase perceptions of Palin's feminine charisma, while those that highlight masculine traits have null effects on perceptions of Palin's masculine charisma. Partisanship moderates these effects. Moreover, as one might expect, increased perceptions of Palin as a charismatic figure increase positive feelings toward her as a candidate.

We argue that structural and contextual factors, such as type of institutions, election systems, and jurisdictional racial makeup, may influence the calculations women of color make concerning the accessibility of elective office. Using data from the Gender and Multiracial Leadership (GMCL) project, we find county offices to be the least, and seats on school boards the most, accessible to women of color. Of the types of electoral arrangements, we find multimember districts (MMD) to be the most significant variable predicting the likelihood of women of color in office. Although both Black and Latina women benefit from having a significant share of coethnics or nonwhites in jurisdictions, the two groups of women have an opposite relationship to their racial constituent makeup than that held by their male counterparts.

Using a unique survey of all 13,000 locally elected politicians in Sweden (response rate 63 percent), we find a negative association between a greater presence of women and male politicians' personal willingness to strive for women's interests. However, there is no such effect on male politicians' support for gender equality as an abstract ideal. We argue that the found pattern can likely be explained by the fact that it may be costly for male politicians to personally strive for women's interests, whereas it does not cost them anything to commit to gender equality as an abstract ideal.

Drawing on original field research, this article explains the success of abortion reform based on the existence of a strong campaign for decriminalization. The women's movement used frames that resonated within civil society, gathered support from key social actors, and collaborated closely with sympathetic legislators. In addition, three contextual factors ensured both the availability and success of these strategies: a weak presence of the Catholic Church, a president not opposed to abortion reform, and a highly institutionalized party system with a strong leftist coalition.

J	Cairns, MR; Workman, CL; Tandon, I				Cairns, Maryann R.; Workman, Cassandra L.; Tandon, Indrakshi			Gender mainstreaming and water development projects: analyzing unexpected enviro-social impacts in Bolivia, India, and Lesotho	GENDER PLACE AND CULTURE			English	Article						Women; water supply; equity and inclusion; NGOs; development	POLITICAL ECOLOGY; RESOURCES MANAGEMENT; COMMUNITY; WOMEN; SOUTH; PARTICIPATION; EMPOWERMENT; ECONOMIES; AFRICA; VOICES	Gender mainstreaming policies and programs, meant to be gender-sensitive or to target gender issues, are increasingly implemented by both governmental and non-governmental actors. However, these projects seem set to continually aim solely at women, despite more than a decade of work encouraging broader scope. Using recent case studies from Bolivia, Lesotho, and India, we address the tensions laden in three major questions about water, gender, and development: (1) Is mandatory inclusion of women in water governance and decision-making effective?, (2) Do water development projects provide equal benefits and burdens for women and men?, and (3) In what ways are water projects and their policies impacting and impacted by gendered enviro-social spaces? By providing triangulated data from ethnographic studies in three distinct local contexts, we are able to pinpoint major cross-cutting themes that serve to highlight and interrogate the gendered impacts of water development projects' policies: public and private lives, women's labor expectations, and managing participation. We find that gender mainstreaming endeavors continue to fall short in their aim to equitably include women in their programming and that geographic, environmental, and socio-cultural spaces are intimately related to how these equitability issues play out. We provide practical recommendations on how to address these issues. ResumenLas politicas y programas de transversalizacion de genero, disenadas para ser sensibles al genero o con objetivos en temas relacionados con este, se implementan cada vez mas tanto por actores gubernamentales como no gubernamentales. Sin embargo, estos proyectos parecen programados para apuntar unicamente y en forma continua a las mujeres, a pesar de mas de una decada de trabajo alentando un abordaje mas abarcativo. Utilizando estudios de caso recientes de Bolivia, Lesoto e India, analizamos las tensiones generadas en tres cuestiones principales acerca del agua, el genero y el desarrollo: 1) Es efectiva la obligatoriedad de la incorporacion de las mujeres en la gobernanza y la toma de decisiones sobre el agua?, 2) Los proyectos de desarrollo hidrico brindan los mismos beneficios y cargas a las mujeres que a los hombres?, y 3) De que maneras los proyectos de agua y sus politicas estan impactando en los espacios socioambientales generizados, y de que manera estan siendo impactados por estos? Ofreciendo datos triangulados de estudios etnograficos en tres contextos locales distintos, pudimos identificar importantes temas transversales que sirven para destacar e interrogar los impactos generizados de las politicas de los proyectos de desarrollo hidrico: las vidas publicas y privadas, las expectativas laborales de las mujeres y la administracion de la participacion. Encontramos que los esfuerzos en pos de una transversalizacion del genero continuan teniendo sus limites en su intento por incluir de forma equitativa a las mujeres en su programacion y que los espacios geograficos, ambientales y socioculturales estan intimamente relacionados con la forma en que se desarrollan estos temas de equidad. Brindamos recomendaciones practicas sobre como abordar estos problemas. ???????????????????????????,?????????????????????????????????????,???????????????????????,?????????????,?????,?????????????????(1)????????????????????(2)????????????????????????????(3)?????????????????????????????????????????????????????????,??????????????????????????????????????????,???????,??????????,????????,???????????????????,?????????????,???????????????????????????????????

Devout Muslim masculinities: the moral geographies and everyday practices of being men in Turkey	GENDER PLACE AND CULTURE			English	Article						Masculinity; piety; morality; embodiment; dress; moral geography; looking; desiring; urban; Islam; Istanbul; Konya	HEGEMONIC MASCULINITY; CULTURAL POLITICS; FOOTBALL; GENDER; ISLAM	While the academic focus on Muslim women's dress and comportment has enriched our understanding of the multifaceted formation of pious femininities, there has been much less consideration of the embodied practices of Muslim men. What work does exist on Middle Eastern men's piety, sexuality, and everyday conduct too often falls back on established categories, such as traditional, Western, or Islamic identities. Yet it is crucial not only to critically examine how we conceptualize masculinity in the Middle East, but also to recognize the political and cultural importance of how masculinities are enacted through everyday practices. In this article, we argue that questions of dress and bodily practice are relevant to an understanding of how young devout Muslim men navigate the complex spatiality of piety, morality, and masculinity in contemporary urban Turkey. Drawing on fieldwork with young devout men in Konya and Istanbul, we illustrate how multiple, competing devout Muslim masculinities participate in the production of uneven moral geographies in these two very different Turkish cities. Further, we find that the possibility of different ways to enact devout masculinity opens questions about the universality of Islamic knowledge and practice. We suggest that the embodied construction and regulation of the looking-desiring nexus tethers male sexual desire to the public performance of Islamic morality. Our intervention is thus to demonstrate how different versions of masculinity and Islamic piety striate the moral geographies of these two Turkish cities, and thereby to further recognition of the contingency and plurality of both masculinity and Islam. ResumenAunque el centro de la investigacion sobre la forma de vestir y el comportamiento de las mujeres musulmanas ha enriquecido nuestra comprension de la formacion multifacetica de las feminidades piadosas, se le ha dado mucha menos consideracion a las practicas encarnadas de los hombres musulmanes. El trabajo que si existe sobre la piedad, la sexualidad y la conducta cotidiana de los hombres de Medio Oriente, con demasiada frecuencia cae en categorias establecidas, tales como las identidades tradicionales, occidentales o islamicas. Sin embargo es fundamental no solamente examinar en forma critica como conceptualizamos la masculinidad en el Medio Oriente, sino tambien reconocer la importancia politica y cultural de como las masculinidades son expresadas a traves de las practicas cotidianas. En este articulo, sostenemos que las cuestiones sobre el vestir y las practicas corporales son relevantes para comprender como los hombres jovenes musulmanes devotos surcan la espacialidad compleja de la piedad, la moralidad y la masculinidad en la Turquia urbana contemporanea. Basandonos en un trabajo de campo con hombres jovenes devotos en Konya y Estambul, ilustramos como las masculinidades musulmanas devotas multiples que compiten entre si participan en la produccion de geografias morales desiguales en estas dos ciudades turcas muy distintas entre si. Ademas, encontramos que la posibilidad de diferentes formas de representar la masculinidad devota abre cuestiones sobre la universalidad del conocimiento y practicas islamicos. Sostenemos que la construccion encarnada y la regulacion del nexo del mirar-desear ata el deseo sexual masculino a la performance publica de la moralidad islamica. Nuestra intervencion sirve entonces para demostrar como las versiones diferentes de la masculinidad y la piedad islamicas estrian las geografias morales de estas dos ciudades turcas y por lo tanto avanza el reconocimiento de la contingencia y la pluralidad tanto de la masculinidad como del Islam.

The point of departure being that the term queer has emerged to qualify a specific scholarship that contests normative orders in gender and sexuality, and that queering is a form of critique of multiple power relations that informs knowledge production. Normative sex and gender orders are reflected in the power-knowledge relations that produce queerness' as outsider, abnormal and subaltern. In order to challenge these normativities, the production of knowledge must be contested in its conception. Here we present the theoretical framework that grounds our themed issue as well a short summary of the articles in this series. ResumenEste volumen tematico contribuye a las discusiones de las posicionalidades queer en el contexto en el que se lleva a cabo el trabajo de campo sobre/con sujetos que se definen como queer. El punto de partida es que el termino queer surgio para calificar a un tipo especifico de investigacion que desafia los ordenes normativos en el genero y la sexualidad, y que el queering es una forma de critica de las multiples relaciones de poder que influye sobre la produccion de conocimiento. El orden sexual y de genero se ve reflejado en las relaciones de poder-conocimiento que produce la queeridad como algo extranjero, anormal y subalterno. Con el objetivo de desafiar estas normatividades, la produccion de conocimiento debe ser desafiada en su concepcion.

Or the epistemological consequences of neglecting the lusty researcher's body	GENDER PLACE AND CULTURE			English	Article						Desire; sexuality; reflexivity; researcher; geographies of sexualities; knowledge production	SEXUALITY; SEX; ENCOUNTERS; FIELDWORK; STIGMA; BODIES; DESIRE	This article investigates the dichotomy within research on sexuality between the desiring body of the informant on the one hand and the non-desiring body of the researcher on the other. Despite earlier calls to acknowledge and include the eroticisms of the researcher, accounts where the desiring researcher's body is a central focus remain exceptions to the rule. The main goal of this intervention is to investigate why the absence of the lusty researcher's body seems to endure. I will first explore some of the reasons researchers might feel inhibited to self-disclose their desires, to continue with uncovering some of the techniques used to sustain the cover of the asexual, disembodied researcher. Afterwards, I will discuss my own experiences as a (junior) researcher in the field, mainly my own discomfort and embarrassment to be perceived as a desiring woman-researcher, and trace how this has informed my own research trajectory. I conclude by suggesting that writing down our negotiations between the validity of our research versus how much we are willing to self-disclose might be a first step towards an improved inclusion of lust and desire in sex research. ResumenEste articulo investiga la dicotomia, dentro de la investigacion sobre sexualidad, entre el cuerpo deseante del/la informante por un lado y el cuerpo no-deseante del/la investigador/a por el otro. A pesar de llamados previos a reconocer e incluir los eroticismos del/la investigador/a, los relatos en los que el foco es el cuerpo deseante del/la investigador/a. El objetivo principal de esta investigacion es analizar por que perdura la ausencia del cuerpo deseante del/la investigador/a. En primer lugar exploro algunas de las razones por las que lxs investigadorxs pueden sentirse inhibidxs de exponer sus deseos, continuando con la develacion de algunas de las tecnicas utilizadas para mantener la mascara del/la investigador/a asexuadx, y descorporizadx. Luego, discutire mis propias experiencias como (joven) investigadora en el trabajo de campo, principalmente mi propia incomodidad y verguenza a ser percibida como una mujer-investigadora que desea, analizando como esto influyo mi propia trayectoria de investigacion. Concluyo sugiriendo que escribir nuestras negociaciones entre la validez de nuestra investigacion versus cuanto estamos dispuestxs a sincerarnos podria ser un primer paso hacia una inclusion mejorada de la lujuria y el deseo en la investigacion sexual.

J	Ahn, K				Ahn, Kyungju			Ambivalent gender power in interstitial space: The case of transnational South Korean mothers	ASIAN JOURNAL OF WOMENS STUDIES			English	Article						Transnational social space; interstices; mutual surveillance; social capital; communication filtering; transnational mothering; ICTs; transnational life	MIGRATION; FAMILIES; COMMUNICATION; EDUCATION; INTIMACIES; DIASPORA; DISTANCE; INTERNET; CHILDREN; CYBERIA	This article describes the maintenance of transnationally split families and the creation of new relationships in the new social space occupied by Korean mothers. During two years of ethnographic field-work in four cities in New York State in the US, I examined how family members communicated with each other in order to maintain long-distance relationships through physical co-presence and virtual communication via information and communication technologies (ICTs). Transnational actors used these selectively based on socioeconomic and cultural practices. In the case of the South Korean mothers, mutual (financial) surveillance and communication filtering were selected differently, depending on socioeconomic factors. Gendered power relations surrounding ICTs and transnationalism cannot be seen as unidirectional, but represent a rather complex and ambivalent picture. This study investigates women's strategies for managing family affairs, mutual surveillance by spouses, communication filtering and accumulation of social capital in the interstices of a transnational social space.

J	Dey, S; Basak, P				Dey, Soma; Basak, Palash			Out of the shadows: Women and wage struggle in the RMG industry of Bangladesh	ASIAN JOURNAL OF WOMENS STUDIES			English	Article						RMG (ready-made garments); women workers; low wages; irregular payment; agency; labor protest		The export-oriented readymade garment (RMG) industry of Bangladesh has flourished quite rapidly, taking the advantage of the considerable supply of local labor. From its very beginning, RMG entrepreneurs have been showing greater interest in recruiting timid' women to ensure administrative control over the workers. Thus, labor exploitation by providing low and irregular wages has sustained this sector. Shedding light on women's agency and choice, this article shows that so far the apparently silent' workers permit the global industry to continue with cheap' labor, driven by a gendered ideology, structural and material constraints. But women workers are moving forward to ensure wage justice. Assessing the achievements and drawbacks of the wage struggle, our study envisions women's more effective role in securing wider labor rights in the RMG sector.

J	Jeong, S; Shin, K				Jeong, Semyong; Shin, Kyunghee			Korean women in the forest mushroom industry: A case study	ASIAN JOURNAL OF WOMENS STUDIES			English	Article						Pyogo mushroom; rural masculinity; patriarchy; rural women; gender division of labor; empowerment	COMMUNITY FORESTRY; MANAGEMENT; FRAMEWORK; GENDER	The pyogo mushroom is an interesting non-timber product which is cultivated by people living in or near the forests. It is a rare crop that provides economic security to people in the forest areas. At the same time, pyogo mushroom cultivation has had a contradictory effect on women. Forest mushroom cultivation has a centralized male-labor force and a marginalized female labor force. However, some women have refused to be victimized and try to find their empowerment strategies through its cultivation. Our research defines women as active agents of change and emphasizes their energy and ability. We selected ten women for individual, in-depth interviews in order to examine their consciousness regarding gender roles and how they challenge these. In doing this, we analyze how women utilize the pyogo mushroom industry, which is gender-biased, as an empowerment opportunity. The theoretical section includes a literature review for understanding the masculine and patriarchal traditions of the mountainous rural areas of Korea and empowerment strategies from third world feminism. The interview results showed that participants succeeded in confronting traditional gender divisions and in partially or fully controlling their income from pyogo cultivation. In our conclusion, we suggest how their empowerment can be supported so that they may become more effective at local and national levels.

J	Mishra, S				Mishra, Swati			Recasting respectability: Imagination, desire and modernity among call-center workers in India	ASIAN JOURNAL OF WOMENS STUDIES			English	Article						Call center; habitus; Bangalore; reflexivity; gender; young women	GENDER; BANGALORE	This article explores changing gendered identities of young, unmarried, Indian, middle class women who work in transnational call centres (TNCs) in Bangalore, within the broader context of cultural globalization. While the entry of these organizations has enhanced employment opportunities for the younger population in India, the workplace presents a contested cultural terrain to its female workers, who uphold their traditional class values as an integral part of their modern identities. I portray the richness and depth of the changing aspirations towards individualization, careers and marriage of such women, who migrate from semi-urban areas and become part of a global cultural space. Based on ethnographic research, I suggest that, while these young women frequently frame themselves as dutiful daughters, their attitudes and actions point towards reconfigurations of their identities as modern, professional Indian women, skilled in navigating the altered cultural and economic contexts of their lives in Bangalore.

The analysis shares terrain covered by other studies that examine the link between US militarism and Asian sex industries. In addition, this paper considers how racialized and sexualized power structures situate Amerasian women in specific ways in relation to sex work in the Philippines. A feminist post-colonial approach, including discourses on race, miscegenation and nationalism, provides a fresh perspective on how colonial and post-colonial structures and systems of power have shaped the sex industry as it is today, contributing to what may be an overrepresentation of Filipina Amerasians in sex work. ABSTRACT IN TAGALOGAng papel na ito explores ang makasaysayang at panlipunang kultural na mga kadahilanan na ihubog Pilipino Amerasian partisipasyon ng kababaihan sa sex trabaho sa Olongapo pulang ilaw distrito, katabi ng dating US Subic Bay Naval Base.

Ang isang peminista post-kolonyal na diskarte, kabilang ang mga diskurso sa lahi, paghahalo ng mga lahi at nasyonalismo, ay nagbibigay ng isang sariwang pananaw sa kung paano kolonyal at post-kolonyal na kaayusan at sistema ng kapangyarihan ay may hugis ng sex industry dahil ito ay ngayon, nag-aambag sa kung ano ang maaaring maging isang overrepresentation ng Filipina Amerasians sa sex trabaho.			lora.chapman@rmit.edu.au						60	0	0	1	1	EWHA WOMANS UNIV PRESS	SEOUL	11-1 DAEHYUN-DONG, SEODAEMUN-GU, SEOUL 120-750, SOUTH KOREA	1225-9276	2377-004X		ASIAN J WOMEN STUD	Asian J.

In her childhood, she faced discrimination as an unwanted girl child; she was married at an early age and abandoned by her husband during her third pregnancy at the age of 20. But her determination to overcome all the tribulations of life through her perseverance to live and bring about change in the lives of orphaned children makes her a role model for women around the world to lead successful and fulfilling lives. Sindhutai constructed over six orphanages in Maharashtra, India to provide food, shelter, and education to such children. Her success in providing basic facilities to orphans made her a truly empowered woman. But her struggle continues, while she raises funds to run her orphanages.
