J	Cai, SS				Cai Shenshen			Li Yugang and His Transgender Performance: Body Politics, Entertainment and Aesthetic Ambiguity	INTERSECTIONS-GENDER AND SEXUALITY IN ASIA AND THE PACIFIC			English	Editorial Material							GENDER	I have never thought a transgender male character could be so beautiful; 'she' is pure and classical in style. 'Her' beauty has superseded the majority of females, 'she' walks majestically, 'her' smile and glimpse touches one's soul. ' She' elegantly waves 'her' sleeves. I know that I am a man but when I watch 'her' performing, I am absolutely captivated and can't control my feelings towards 'her', and this internal conflict has made me question my sexuality.[ 1] His uncommon quality in arts vividly demonstrates the appeal of his femininity, elegantly rather than extravagantly, prettily rather than pretentiously. He is more feminine than woman. This is a kind of beauty that encompasses female prettiness in the modern world. Not only is it a prettiness of appearance, but also a prettiness emitting from the heart,-one of temperament. The expression and emotion showing in 'her' eyes is intoxicating.									31	0	0	1	1	AUSTRALIAN NAT UNIV	CANBERRA	DEPT FAR EASTERN HISTORY, CANBERRA, 2600, AUSTRALIA	1440-9151			INTERSECTIONS-GENDER	Intersections	DEC	2017		41												10	Women's Studies	Women's Studies	FV7CX	WOS:000424741700008					2018-09-20

The Reactive Left: Gender Equality and the Latin American Pink Tide	SOCIAL POLITICS			English	Editorial Material							SUBSTANTIVE REPRESENTATION; COMPARATIVE PERSPECTIVE; DOMESTIC VIOLENCE; WOMEN; POLITICS; GOVERNMENTS; ARGENTINA; POLICY; REVOLUTION; SEXUALITY	This introduction assesses the effects of Latin America's pink tide on gender equality in the region. We find that left governments and left competition provide an opportunity for advancing gender equality. However, the dominant pattern during Latin America's pink tide was one of a reactive left. Pink tide governments typically did not have clearly articulated gender equality initiatives on their immediate policy agendas. Instead, left governments mostly reacted to pressures from domestic gender equality activists. In addition to left ideology and feminist mobilization, left party type and policy type explain progress and setbacks in gender equality across six outcome areas.

J	Filgueira, F; Franzoni, JM				Filgueira, Fernando; Martinez Franzoni, Juliana			The Divergence in Women's Economic Empowerment: Class and Gender under the Pink Tide	SOCIAL POLITICS			English	Article								Since 1990, men's monopoly over economic resources, a key feature of gender inequality, has been irreversibly eroded across Latin America. Women's access to income of their own has improved in dramatic ways. The most significant change preceded the Pink Tide years, fueled by structural conditions such as fertility drops and neoliberal policies' downward pressure on male wages and employment. However, women's access to resources remained conditioned by their socioeconomic status and the sexual division of labor at home. Against this backdrop, the Pink Tide expanded social income and made some progress regarding gender and class inequalities separately, yet not their perverse interactions.

We find that left governments did not strengthen quota laws more than right governments. Further, after controlling for confounding factors, we find that left parties did not nominate or elect more women. Rather, we find the decision environment shapes parties' choices about women candidates: when citizens distrust political parties, parties nominate more women, but when citizens evaluate the economy poorly, and when parties face many challengers, they nominate more men. Thus, the decision environments in which parties operate overshadow the effects of ideology.

We assess whether the left turn led to the political empowerment of indigenous women by comparing the center-right government of Peru with the left-wing governments of Bolivia and Ecuador. We find that left governments perform better, but among the left, type of left party matters. Moreover, equally important is the strength of indigenous movements and indigenous women's organizing.

We conduct a cross-national comparison of gender policy machinery governance models, taking three well-established models-bureaucratic, participatory, and transformative-as empirical guidance. We find that no one clear model is associated with government ideology. By studying four cases in-depth-Argentina, Brazil, Mexico, and Venezuela-we provide a more nuanced interpretation of how governance models are influenced by an interaction between party type, broader state capacities, and participatory structures.

J	Beer, C				Beer, Caroline			Left Parties and Violence against Women Legislation in Mexico	SOCIAL POLITICS			English	Article							GENDER	Are governments with stronger left parties more likely to implement comprehensive violence against women (VAW) laws? This paper combines a qualitative historical study with a statistical analysis of the most recent wave of policy reform. The historical analysis shows that VAW initiatives were typically proposed by feminist legislators from centrist or leftist parties, often with close ties to the feminist movement. The regression results show that the strength of leftist parties in the state legislature does not have a significant effect on the comprehensiveness or implementation of VAW laws, but the strength of the feminist movement does.

Using a unique and newly collected data set of 6,317 K-pop fans from 100 countries around the world, this study examines the relationship between individual K-pop consumption and gender attitudes of K-pop fans. Findings suggest that a higher level of spending on K-pop related items and activities is related to less egalitarian gender attitudes. Interestingly, this correlation is stronger for fans from already less gender-equal nations. Results indicate that the industry that is actively promoted by the Korean government includes elements that might reinforce a sexist culture and traditional gender roles both within Korea and around the globe, further obstructing women's pursuit of equal opportunities.

Specifically, we investigate the impact of institutional female directors as a whole, differentiating by whether female directors have business ties with the firms' boards on which they sit (pressure-sensitive female directors) or do not have business links (pressure-resistant female directors). We hypothesize that there is a nonlinear association, specifically quadratic, between institutional, pressure-resistant and pressure-sensitive female directors on boards, and CEO compensation. Our findings show that CEO compensation decreases with low levels of institutional female directors and pressure-resistant female directors on boards, but when their presence on boards increases beyond a certain threshold, CEO compensation also increases. We also find that CEO compensation is not affected by pressure-sensitive female directors on boards. These findings support the premise that institutional female directors on boards cannot be considered a homogeneous group, but play an important role in managerial monitoring and remuneration policies, thus affecting the corporate governance system.

The interrogation records of the accused female sodomites illustrate the remarkable self-consciousness of early modern women with same-sex desires. Their attitudes collided, however, with popular mentalities towards female sodomy, which local testimonies explained away as a physical abnormality or an act of diabolical witchcraft. This article offers an in-depth analysis of these discourses in order to gain a fuller understanding of the perception of female sodomy in early modern urban society.

FEMALE MASCULINITIES, DISSIDENT SEXUALITY, AND THE MATERIAL POLITICS OF GENDER IN EARLY TWENTIETH-CENTURY IGBOLAND	JOURNAL OF WOMENS HISTORY			English	Article							COLONIALISM; BIOGRAPHY; NIGERIA; AFRICA; WOMEN	Colonialism, Christianity, and Western education alienated women from the dominant resources of social mobility, which resulted in the masculinization of wealth in early twentieth-century Igboland. This article examines women's individual challenges to changing practices of gendered access, sexuality, and power. By performing ogaranya (wealth-power) masculinity through trade, mediumship, and matronship, Ohafia women expanded the ideological scope of gender hegemony beyond colonial patriarchal structures. The case studies of two Ohafia women, Unyang Uka and Otuwe Agwu, who performed ogaranya masculinity and the dissident sexuality of oke-nwami (masculine female husband), bridge a gap in gender theory in African studies by reconciling the literature on West African women's power and authority with the nascent field of African masculinity studies. They show that changes in women's sociopolitical power paralleled the shifting constructions of masculinity in West Africa. Igbo women's masculinity performances simultaneously elided and reinforced changing notions of gendered power.

J	Weis, J				Weis, Julianne			Medicalization and Maternal Health: The Use of Female Health Auxiliaries to Modernize Ethiopia under Haile Selassie, 1930-1974	JOURNAL OF WOMENS HISTORY			English	Article								This article contributes to larger twentieth-century debates on the process of childbirth's medicalization and the increasing insertion of medicine into maternal health. Focusing on Ethiopia, the article describes how the nation's first medical network co-opted women into development schemes, using childbirth and maternity care as symbols for larger concerns about reforming "backward traditions" in the name of socioeconomic progress. Women engaged in this cultural reformation both as medical practitioners and patients, working to "modernize" domestic practices to effect national levels of development and change. Women's participation in medicine, however, was highly restricted: working only as nurses and midwives, women were trained merely to prevent crises of birthing through social education and cultural reform, not "cure" obstetric emergencies common among Ethiopian women. This limitation in modern maternity care in Ethiopia is further evidence of the largely symbolic nature of medicine's insertion in the practices of childbirth. Childbirth is socially controlled in all societies. In no society is the process of pregnancy and parturition treated as simply a physiological process, untouched by a cultural context, prescriptions, proscriptions, and customary practices.

J	Roth, C				Roth, Cassia			Policing Pregnancy: Reproduction, Poverty, and the Law in Early Twentieth-Century Rio de Janeiro	JOURNAL OF WOMENS HISTORY			English	Article							INFANTICIDE; ABORTION	At the turn of the twentieth century, women across the Americas experienced increased scrutiny over their reproductive lives. The Brazilian city of Rio de Janeiro presents one crucial case study for understanding how the uneven process of modernization affected women's reproduction, and, in turn, how women negotiated these changes. This article explores police attitudes towards poor women's reproductive lives during Brazil's First Republic (1889-1930) and the early period of Getulio Vargas's regime (1930-1937). During this time period, Brazil experienced a shift from familial to state patriarchy, and women's sexual lives-and honorbecame public goods. I argue that police practice embedded patriarchal definitions of honor into modern judicial and societal attitudes toward women's bodies. As the state began controlling women's sexuality, the police played an active role defining and monitoring women's reproductive lives. But women actively negotiated police scrutiny over their reproduction in ways that complicated any monolithic consolidation of patriarchal norms.

WIFE, MOTHER, AND WORKER: The Decision to Work in Early-Twentieth Century Sao Paulo	JOURNAL OF WOMENS HISTORY			English	Article							SPANISH IMMIGRANTS	This article examines the degree to which working-class women embodied the roles of wife, mother, and worker in early-industrial Sao Paulo, Brazil (1900-1930). By juxtaposing employment evidence from the Jafet textile factory with personal stories and anecdotal evidence, the article highlights the complex decisions these women made to return to and remain in the formal labor market. As workers, these women could work toward personal and family goals and gain some degree of personal satisfaction. For middle-class women, formal employment was often mutually exclusive from being a wife and mother. This was not the case for working-class women; nationality, however, impacted the degree to which working-class women entered the formal labor market. Married women in Spanish households sought employment in times of extreme economic necessity. In contrast, Italian mothers were more prominent in textile factories than either women of other nationalities or their single Italian cohort.

HONEST CITIZENS AND A "GRAVE MORAL THREAT": Prostitution, Public Women, and Political Transition in Postdictatorial Dominican Republic, 1964-1978	JOURNAL OF WOMENS HISTORY			English	Article							DEMOCRACY	In 1966, following the demise of a brutal thirty-year dictatorship, the Dominican Republic faced a difficult political transition. President Joaquin Balaguer, collaborator in the previous regime, offered promises of democratization and progress. In response, citizens wrote copious letters decrying the brothels and women of the "licentious life" in their neighborhoods as a threat to the Dominican future. While the new regime endeavored to respond to their demands, it also sought national conciliation through the appointment of various female officials to political posts across the nation. For citizens, however, the capacity of the Dominican government to respond progressively and transparently to the "grave moral threat" of prostitution was the measure of the nation's capacity to heal and progress. In sum, citizen and government discourse surrounding the role of women in the public sphere reveals the centrality of the female body in the transition from authoritarian rule to the drama of national reconstruction.

The Femininity-Money Incongruity Hypothesis: Money and Femininity Reminders Undermine Women's Cognitive Performance	PSYCHOLOGY OF WOMEN QUARTERLY			English	Article						money; gender roles; sexism; Stroop; cognition	STEREOTYPE THREAT; SOCIAL IDENTITY; SELF-CONCEPT; REJECTION; MEN; BELONGINGNESS; MATHEMATICS; SCIENCE; POWER; PAIN	Women are often stereotyped as poorly equipped to deal with money matters, compared to men, yet very little research has examined the underpinnings and consequences of such gender stereotypes. Drawing on descriptive and prescriptive elements of women's social roles, we empirically examined the gendered nature of money stereotypes. Specifically in the current work, we introduced and investigated the femininity-money incongruity hypothesis, which suggests that when the concepts of femininity and money are both cognitively activated, money will become a liability for women, causing decrements in cognitive functioning. We first probed the role of gender identity and benevolent sexism beliefs in women's endorsement of money-gender stereotypes. In two subsequent experiments, we tested the hypothesis that simultaneously activating money and femininity would lead to decrements in cognitive functioning. Converging results across studies suggest that money is incompatible with the stereotypic female gender identity, and this incongruity has detrimental cognitive costs for women as they navigate gender roles. Implications of societal challenges imposed on women by gender stereotypes regarding money matters at work and in relationship contexts and proposed interventions are discussed.

In the current work, we hypothesized that the core social need to belong explains persistence in pSTEM for women more so than for men. We conducted three field studies with data from close to 3,000 participants bridging a wide span of higher education levels and differing pSTEM fields. In each study, we found gender disparities on sense of belonging in pSTEM favoring men. Moreover, sense of belonging explained persistence intentions for both women and men in one study and explained persistence intentions and actual persistence in pSTEM coursework for women, more so than for men, in the other two studies, even after controlling for two conventional predictors of academic achievement (self-efficacy and exam performance). These results highlight the role of belonging in gender differences in pSTEM persistence and indicate STEM educators should strive to create inclusive learning environments for all students.

There is some initial evidence that unacknowledged victims are at elevated re-victimization risk relative to acknowledged victims. In the current study, we sought to identify mediators of the association between acknowledgment of rape and re-victimization in a sample of 319 college rape victims; 187 (58.6%) participants completed a 2-month follow-up study. We examined regular drinking, number of sexual partners, and continuing a relationship with the assailant as potential mediators of the relation between acknowledgment and re-victimization. At follow-up, unacknowledged victims reported higher rates of new attempted (16.2%) and completed rape (11.9%), relative to acknowledged victims (attempted: 7.9%; completed: 3.0%). Number of sexual partners mediated the relation between acknowledgment and attempted rape. Both number of partners and regular drinking mediated the relation between acknowledgment and completed rape. Thus, not acknowledging rape may be associated with re-victimization in part because unacknowledged victims may be more likely to engage in behaviors that increase vulnerability. We believe there is a need for longitudinal, theoretically grounded research examining risky behaviors, victimization, and acknowledgment status over time to delineate the relations among these variables.

Social Media Contributions to Strong Black Woman Ideal Endorsement and Black Women's Mental Health	PSYCHOLOGY OF WOMEN QUARTERLY			English	Article						social media; Black women; self-esteem; mental health	AFRICAN-AMERICAN WOMEN; MECHANICAL TURK; COLLECTIVE ACTION; FACEBOOK USAGE; STRENGTH; ACTIVISM; EMPOWERMENT; STRESS; GENDER; COMMUNITIES	Although research findings highlight the complex dualities of the Strong Black Woman ideal and demonstrate its effects on Black women's mental health and well-being, there is less understanding of the role that social media may play in Black women's negotiation of this ideal. To what extent might Black women's engagement with race-related social media, such as the use of Black-oriented blogs and hashtags, contribute to their well-being and potentially buffer contributions of the Strong Black Woman ideal? To investigate this question, we tested 412 Black women who completed online survey measures assessing their general social media use, Black-oriented blog and hashtag use, mental health, and self-esteem. Correlational and regression analyses revealed that, as expected, both greater endorsement of the Strong Black Woman ideal and higher levels of general social media use was associated with adverse mental health and lower self-esteem. Contrary to our expectations, Black-oriented blog use was also associated with more symptoms of depression and anxiety and did not moderate effects of Strong Black Woman endorsement on well-being. Clinicians, instructors, parents, and media activists should be mindful of how the use of both traditional and race-related social media may be both liberating for, and detrimental to, Black women's well-being.

Utilizing grounded theory methodology, we sought to understand how gender and race intersect with unique experiences of oppression to contribute to body dissatisfaction among Asian American women. Twenty Asian American undergraduate women born in the United States participated in semi-structured interviews. The core category body image was composed of attitudes and perceptions about body weight, shape, and size; facial features (e.g., eye size); and skin complexion or tone. Five categories emerged that informed the body image experiences of Asian American women: (1) navigating cultural beauty norms, (2) experiences of sexism and racism, (3) parental influences, (4) peer influences, and (5) identity management processes. Each of these categories appeared to have both positive and negative consequences for appearance evaluation, ranging from self-consciousness to confidence. Participants also described coping strategies for managing these experiences. We encourage psychologists and clinicians to consider culture-specific beauty standards for Asian American women as well as salient racial and cultural factors (e.g., perceived discrimination and biculturative stress) that may influence body image beliefs. Our results offer a new model for understanding Asian American women's body dissatisfaction as rooted in experiences of racism and sexism.

We grouped our sample into visible immigrant women of color and nonvisible White immigrant women. As expected, visible immigrant women reported more experiences of overt discrimination and fewer experiences of ordinary privileges than did nonvisible immigrant women. The associations of belonging to a visible immigrant group with both psychiatric symptoms and satisfaction with life were each mediated through ordinary privileges and overt discrimination. The magnitude of the two indirect effects was equal for psychiatric symptoms, but for satisfaction with life, the indirect effect through ordinary privileges was stronger. After accounting for ordinary privileges and overt discrimination, the average score for satisfaction with life was higher for visible immigrant women than for nonvisible immigrant women. These findings suggest that visible immigrant women experience exclusion from ordinary privileges to a greater extent than nonvisible immigrant women and that this type of exclusion is at least as detrimental to psychological health as more overt forms of discrimination. Our findings demonstrate the importance of attending to discrimination of both visible and nonvisible immigrants and highlight the importance of ordinary privileges to immigrants' well-being in their countries of destination. We discuss implications for future research and social policy.

Stereotype Threat Among Girls: Differences by Gender Identity and Math Education Context	PSYCHOLOGY OF WOMEN QUARTERLY			English	Article						stereotype threat; gender identity; honors math; disengagement; adolescents	TEST-PERFORMANCE; QUANTITATIVE PERFORMANCE; ENGINEERING MAJORS; SOCIAL IDENTITY; SCHOOL STUDENTS; TASK-DIFFICULTY; MODERATING ROLE; SELF-CONCEPT; WOMENS; CHILDREN	Effects of stereotype threat on math performance have been well-documented among college women; however, the prevalence among adolescent girls is less well-known. Further, the moderating role of gender identity and effects of stereotype threat on high achieving girls in math is unknown. This study tested the effects of a stereotype threat condition (vs. control group) among middle school girls in standard and honors math classes and examined gender identity as a moderator. Students (N = 498) completed pre- and post-questionnaires and a math test as part of a stereotype threat experiment. Gender identity moderated effects of stereotype threat on math discounting, disengagement, attitudes, and performance, but whether gender identity was a protective or risk factor differed by math education context (honors math and standard math classes). Gender identity was protective for girls in honors math for attitudes, discounting, and disengagement but was a risk factor for math performance. Gender identity was a risk factor for disengagement and math attitudes among girls in standard math classes, but was a buffer for math performance. Results suggest the need to examine protective and risk properties of gender identity importance for adolescent girls and the need to examine stereotype threat within educational contexts. Stereotype threat can be reduced through interventions; thus, educators and practitioners can collaborate with social scientists to implement widespread interventions in K-12 schools.

The Politics of Delineating Subfields	POLITICS & GENDER			English	Article							INTERNATIONAL-RELATIONS; VIOLENCE; WOMEN	When considering possible conversations, synergies, overlaps, similarities, conflicts, and distinctions between two subfields or camps (Sylvester 2010), the question of limits looms large. Where, why, and how are the limits of feminist security studies (FSS) and feminist global political economy (FGPE) currently being drawn, and to what effect? Building upon previous conversations about the relationship between FSS and FGPE, particularly as they were discussed in the Critical Perspectives section in Politics & Gender (June 2015), as well as those about FSS and FGPE more generally, I briefly touch on a few central points regarding the politics of boundary drawing and the practices of feminist research.

I use Nepali women ex-combatants' life stories to make two specific points relating to these discussions. First, I illustrate how the separation of security and political economy issues cannot fully account for their life experiences. Second, and by way of overcoming this separation, I show how by beginning with life stories, we can develop a holistic analysis that challenges the broader Eurocentric politics of feminist IR knowledge production.

J	Agathangelou, AM				Agathangelou, Anna M.			From the Colonial to Feminist IR: Feminist IR Studies, the Wider FSS/GPE Research Agenda, and the Questions of Value, Valuation, Security, and Violence	POLITICS & GENDER			English	Article							POLITICS; ECONOMY; WOMEN	International relations (IR) feminists have significantly impacted the way we analyze the world and power. However, as Cynthia Enloe points out, there are now signsworrisome signsthat feminist analysts of international politics might be forgetting what they have shared and are making bricks to construct new intellectual barriers. That is not progress (2015, 436). I agree. The project/process that has led to the separation/specialization of feminist security studies (FSS) and feminist global political economy (FGPE) does not constitute progress but instead ends up embodying forms of violence that erase the materialist bases of our intellectual labor's divisions (Agathangelou 1997), the historical and social constitution of our formations as intellectuals and subjects. This amnesiac approach evades our personal lives and colludes with those forces that allow for the violence that comes with abstraction. These worrisome signs should be explained if we are to move FSS and FGPE beyond a merger (Allison 2015) that speaks only to some issues and some humans in the global theater.

In this forum, the contributors return to some of the same ground, but in doing so, they bring in new concerns and agendas. New empirical sites of thinking through the nexus between security and political economy from a feminist perspective are explored: war, women's lives in postconflict societies, and international security governance institutions and practices.

J	Deaux, K				Deaux, Kay			Remembering Janet Taylor Spence (1923-2015)	SEX ROLES			English	Biographical-Item						Feminist psychology; History of psychology; Biography; Gender studies		Janet Taylor Spence was a history-making figure in professional psychology and in the study of gender. In the period between her birth in 1923 and her death in 2015, vast changes took place in both domains, and Janet Spence was at the center of both. This issue of Sex Roles is dedicated to her life and work, providing a perspective and an accounting of the contributions that she made to our field. The set of papers included here chronicle Janet's career path, evaluate the impact of her work in the areas of anxiety and of gender, recount memories from her colleagues and students, and in a closing article, analyze her place in the larger historical domain of women in psychology.

In early work, she constructed the Personal Attributes Questionnaire, or PAQ, consisting of a masculine and a feminine scale, which she interpreted as assessing the core of psychological masculinity and femininity. Spence subsequently recognized that the masculine, or instrumental, scale reliably predicts only self-assertive, dominant behaviors and that the feminine, or expressive, scale reliably predicts only other-oriented, relational behaviors. Moreover, as her work developed, Spence came to understand this self-ascribed instrumentality and expressiveness, not as gender identity, but as two of the several types of psychological attributes that may become associated with individuals' self-categorization as male or female. She then defined gender identity as the basic, existential sense of being male or female, which generally corresponds to one's biological sex. Building on her ideas, we argue that gender identity instead encompasses both the sex categorization of oneself, usually as male or female, and self-assessments on gender-stereotypic instrumental and expressive attributes. These two levels of gender identity are linked by people's self-stereotyping to the extent that they value their group membership as male or female.

That is, she both blazed a path for women in academia and contributed to our scientific understanding of the factors that produce and shape such paths. In this piece, I address both these aspects of her life and work. I begin by briefly highlighting Spence's groundbreaking posts in academia and her influence on my own academic career. With respect to her research, I identify five aspects of Spence's work that were innovative and made important, lasting contributions to theoretical and empirical approaches to understanding gender in the United States. I first describe Spence's commitment to challenging the ideological beliefs about gender held by laypeople and scientists alike by engaging in empirical tests of commonly held beliefs. I next review Spence's argument that within-individual variability of gender-typing of the self is normative rather than unusual. Third, I describe Spence's beliefs about the relation between gender-typing of the self and gender-typing of others, and fourth, I describe Spence's work concerning the mechanisms that support self-perceived femininity and masculinity. In the fifth and final section, I highlight Spence's treatment of environmental contributions to gender role development.

Paving the Way: The Distinctive Mentoring Style of Janet Taylor Spence	SEX ROLES			English	Article						Janet Taylor Spence; Mentoring; Gender psychology; Biography	GENDER; ATTITUDES; TRAITS; WOMEN	Janet Taylor Spence (1923-2015), a major figure in American psychology, made seminal scientific contributions to the fields of anxiety and gender psychology. In this essay, the authors, both former Spence students, weave a tapestry of her teaching and mentoring by using as the threads Spence's reflections on her professional life, the authors' personal experiences with Spence, and findings from the relevant career literature. Three areas of teaching and mentoring are used to illustrate Spence's distinctive yet highly effective style of mentoring: (a) modeling and insisting on careful thinking, (b) serving as an intentional role model, and (c) assisting in negotiating the hazards of academia. A conceptual explanation is provided for each area, together with specific examples illustrating how Spence employed these strategies.

J	Rutherford, A				Rutherford, Alexandra			Contextualizing a Life in Science: Janet Taylor Spence and the History of Women and Gender in American Psychology	SEX ROLES			English	Article						Gender; Biography; History of science; Psychology of women	SEX; WAR; MASCULINITY; FEMINISM; WORK	The present paper reflects on the life and career of Janet Spence (1923-2015) by situating her experiences within the history of women and gender in American psychology. This history has revealed the structural factors that have affected women's participation in psychology, the shared themes in women's interpersonal and professional experiences, and the specific strategies that women have used to navigate an androcentric, and at times overtly sexist, discipline. In spanning the second half of the twentieth century, Spence's career provides an interesting case study of how these decades of institutional and political change affected a specific woman scientist and her science. I argue that her biography can offer rich insights into the complexly intertwined, and even reflexive, relationships among psychologists, their psychologies, and their contexts.

Although others attribute changing gender inequality to the market transition, we draw from Chinese feminist critical analyses and propose a theoretical framework regarding how the two-sphere separation in contemporary China, embedded in how gender equality was organized in the socialist time, has been driven by the state and is further justified by changing gender ideologies. We review the existing literature and identify gaps in research on how women's disadvantages in the public and private spheres-in the labor market and within the family-mutually reinforce each other in post-reform urban China. We also discuss how the dynamics of, and interactions between, the two spheres are justified by a changing gender ideology. Finally, by exploring gender inequality in the process of the two-sphere separation in a transitional context, we make an important contribution to the general sociological and gender literature.

Guided by community voices, feminist theories, and qualitative empirical research, we reviewed two decades of global quantitative research on sexuality among women living with HIV. In the 32 studies we found, conducted in 25 countries and composed mostly of cis-gender heterosexual women, sexuality was narrowly constructed as sexual behaviours involving risk (namely, penetration) and physiological dysfunctions relating to HIV illness, with far less attention given to the fullness of sexual lives in context, including more positive and rewarding experiences such as satisfaction and pleasure. Findings suggest that women experience declines in sexual activity, function, satisfaction, and pleasure following HIV diagnosis, at least for some period. The extent of such declines, however, is varied, with numerous contextual forces shaping women's sexual well-being. Clinical markers of HIV (e.g., viral load, CD4 cell count) poorly predicted sexual outcomes, interrupting widely held assumptions about sexuality for women with HIV. Instead, the effects of HIV-related stigma intersecting with inequities related to trauma, violence, intimate relations, substance use, poverty, aging, and other social and cultural conditions primarily influenced the ways in which women experienced and enacted their sexuality. However, studies framed through a medical lens tended to pathologize outcomes as individual "problems," whereas others driven by a public health agenda remained primarily preoccupied with protecting the public from HIV. In light of these findings, we present a new feminist approach for research, policy, and practice toward understanding and enhancing women's sexual lives-one that affirms sexual diversity; engages deeply with society, politics, and history; and is grounded in women's sexual rights.

Overcoming Functional Fixedness in Naming Traditions: A Commentary on Pilcher's Names and "Doing Gender"	SEX ROLES			English	Review						Gender roles; Marriage attitudes; Sexism; Surnames; Forenames	SAME-SEX RELATIONSHIPS; HIDDEN POWER; MARRIAGE; PERCEPTIONS; STUDENTS; SURNAME; ADULTS; WOMEN	Because people's names are central to everyday life, their role in the gender system is often overlooked. In the target article, Pilcher (2017) brings novel attention to the ways in which naming traditions allow individuals to enact gender in their lives. In this commentary, I expand on Pilcher's argument that naming traditions merit more attention than they currently receive. Specifically, I begin by discussing links between forenaming and the gender binary. I then describe the ways in which the marital surname tradition reflects gendered power dynamics. In an effort to spur additional scholarly attention to naming traditions, I also delineate fruitful areas for future research. These future directions primarily focus on identifying why and how individuals "do gender differently" through their naming practices.

J	Ferreday, D				Ferreday, Debra			'Only the Bad Gyal could do this': Rihanna, rape-revenge narratives and the cultural politics of white feminism	FEMINIST THEORY			English	Article						Celebrity; intersectionality; media; rape culture; revenge; Rihanna; shame; surveillance; violence; whiteness		In July 2015, Rihanna released a seven-minute long video for her new single, entitled Bitch Better Have My Money' (more widely known as BBHMM'), the violent imagery in which would divide feminist media commentators for its representation of graphic and sexualised violence against a white couple. The resulting commentary would become the focus of much popular and academic feminist debate over the intersectional gendered and racialised politics of popular culture, in particular coming to define what has been termed white feminism'. BBHMM' is not the first time Rihanna's work has been considered in relation to these debates: not only has she herself been very publicly outed as a survivor of male violence, but she has previously dealt with themes of rape and revenge in an earlier video, 2010's Man Down', and in her lyrics. In this article I explore the multiple and layered ways in which Rihanna, and by extension other female artists of colour, are produced by white feminism as both responsible for perpetrating gender-based violence, and as victims in need of rescue. The effect of such liberal feminist critique, I argue, is to hold black female artists responsible for a rape culture that continually subjects women of colour to symbolic and actual violence. In this context, the fantasy violence of Man Down' and to a greater extent BBHMM' dramatises the impossibility of being paid what one is owed' in a culture that produces women of colour's bodies, morality and personal trauma as abjected objects of consumption. I read these two videos through the lens of feminist film theory in order to explore how such representations mobilise affective responses of shame, identification and complicity that are played out in feminist responses to her work, and how their attachment to a simplistic model of representation conceals and reproduces racialised relations of inequality.

J	Smith, KM				Smith, Kate McNicholas			Sexualisation, or the queer feminist provocations of Miley Cyrus	FEMINIST THEORY			English	Article						Drag; femininity; feminist; Miley Cyrus; performance; popular culture; queer; sexualisation	CULTURE; GIRLS; GENDER	Miley Cyrus has increasingly occupied debates at the centre of feminist engagements with popular culture. Evoking concerns around young women and sexualisation', Cyrus emerges as a convergent signifier of sexualised media content and the girl-at-risk. As Cyrus is repeatedly invoked in these debates, she comes to function as the bad object of young femininity. Arguing, however, that Cyrus troubles the sexualisation thesis in the provocations of her creative practice, I suggest that this contested media figure exceeds the frames through which she is read. Thus, I ask: what kinds of insights might be possible if we were to transform the terms on which we approach this figure? Considering a selection of the images and performances that constitute the Cyrus archive, this article proposes a reading of Cyrus as performative provocation. Mobilising an existing sensibility of queer feminist struggle, Cyrus emerges as a disruptive, albeit contradictory, figure. Questions of privilege, limit and possibility emerge in this discussion, as well as what constitutes feminist struggle.

In aiming to move beyond a descriptive treatment, we consider the plurality of user types and their remote use patterns in relation to the resources offered by virtual feminist communities designed to promote increased sociopolitical mobilisation in the fight against violence against women. We will observe the progressive emergence of protest actions organised by Spanish virtual feminist communities, which make use of new technologies to contribute productively to the debate and to political action in innovative organisations and formats. The article discusses how feminist virtual communities are using digital spaces for their work combatting violence against women, and whether this work is apparent to those who experience this violence. Finally, we tackle the implications of this work for online feminist activism in terms of a more interactive and social constructivist model of activism, as well as considering its relationship to institutional-legal discourse and public policies that require women to recognise themselves as victims.

J	Kantola, J; Lombardo, E				Kantola, Johanna; Lombardo, Emanuela			Feminist political analysis: Exploring strengths, hegemonies and limitations	FEMINIST THEORY			English	Article						Feminist theory; gender; intersectionality; new materialism; political analysis; poststructuralism; women	DISCURSIVE INSTITUTIONALISM; GENDER; INTERSECTIONALITY; REPRESENTATION; REFLECTIONS; AUSTERITY; FIELD	Austerity politics, war in the Middle East and at other borders of the European Union, the rise of nationalisms, the emergence of populist parties and politicians, Islamophobia and the refugee crisis are amongst the recent developments suggesting the need for discussions about the theories and concepts that academic disciplines provide for making sense of societal, cultural and political transformations. In this article, we focus on the capacities of feminist political theories to undertake this task. By assessing different feminist approaches to political analysis that range from focusing on women and men, to analysing gender, to doing intersectionality and to adopting post-structural and new materialist approaches, we explore the contributions and the limitations of each framework. This allows us to consider where feminist theoretical debates on gender and politics currently are, to assess old and new developments and to address lacunae in the debate. Our argument is that dominant approaches in political science influence the emergence and marginalisation of particular feminist frameworks for political analysis, but also that feminist theorising of gender and politics, in striving for recognition within mainstream political science, reproduces its own hegemonies and marginalisations.

In this lecture, I present one such model designed to reduce the negative effects of stereotypic biases on women's workplace outcomes. After synthesizing the literature on stereotyping and bias and showing the limits of past change efforts, I develop a small wins model of change. Key to this model is that researchers work with teams of managers to produce concrete, implementable actions that produce visible results. I argue that small wins motivate further action and are the building blocks to larger organizational transformation. Preliminary results from several case studies show that this approach can produce important changes in the short run, such as reducing gender biases in workplace evaluations, and that these small wins can inspire longer run change, such as increases in the rate of hiring women.

It examines the independent and joint effects of motherhood and employment on gender attitudes using combined data from the British Household Panel Survey and the Understanding Society panel study. The results of fixed effects models show no evidence supporting a direct influence of either motherhood or employment on women's attitudes toward a traditional division of labor. However, changes in attitudes are observed when motherhood and employment statuses are considered jointly. Specifically, women are less traditional after the transition to motherhood than before only if motherhood is combined with full-time employment. By contrast, women are more traditional after the transition to motherhood than before only if motherhood coincides with their withdrawal from the labor force. These associations remain robust after considering feedback from earlier attitudes. All the findings suggest that the emergence and realization of incompatibility between women's employment and child-rearing responsibilities reshape women's gender attitudes during the transition to motherhood.

J	Myers, K				Myers, Kit			"If I'm Going to Do It, I'm Going to Do It Right": Intensive Mothering Ideologies among Childless Women Who Elect Egg Freezing	GENDER & SOCIETY			English	Article						reproductive technologies; intensive motherhood; delayed childbearing; egg freezing; work-family conflict	OOCYTE CRYOPRESERVATION; FERTILITY; GENDER; REPRESENTATIONS; PRESERVATION; TECHNOLOGIES; MOTHERHOOD; PARENTHOOD	Researchers have documented the dominance of intensive mothering ideologies and their impact on mothers and their families. However, the effect of these ideologies on childless women has received little attention. I draw on interview data to examine the parenting ideologies of childless women with electively frozen eggs. I demonstrate that incorporation of and commitment to intensive mothering ideologies affect fertility decision making among these childless women. I find that concerns about the heavy burdens of intensive motherhood, coupled with unsupportive partners and workplaces, produce ambivalence toward childbearing and a strategy of fertility postponement. I extend the literatures on intensive mothering, reproductive decision making, assisted reproductive technologies (ARTs), and elective egg freezing by identifying egg freezing as an expression of the gendering of fertility risk and as a means of doing security. Participants view egg freezing as a means of managing risk in two primary ways: as a means of securing access to biogenetic motherhood by managing biological risks of infertility and fetal genetic abnormality, and as a means of enabling intensive parenting by managing temporal risks inherent in coordinating careers, relationships, and childbearing.

I identify bureaucratic harassment as a force by which some servicemen harass, intimidate, and control individual, as well as groups of, servicewomen through bureaucratic channels. Examples include issuing minor infractions with the intention of delaying or stopping promotions, threatening to withhold military benefits for reporting sexual abuse/harassment, and revoking servicewomen's qualifications in order to remove them from positions or units. The manipulation of administrative rules and regulations is made possible by the interplay between a gendered and raced organizational climate and bureaucratic features such as discretion, hierarchy, and the blending of work and personal life. I show that bureaucratic harassment has both raced and gendered implications. Ultimately, harassment that is enacted through bureaucratic means is often overlooked but carries distinct consequences for the professional careers and workplace experiences of the victims.

Rwanda and Bosnia-Herzegovina serve as important examples of this phenomenon, yet a closer examination of both cases reveals the limits on women's capacity to take part in and benefit from these postwar shifts. This article makes two key contributions. First, it demonstrates how the postwar political settlement created hierarchies of victimhood that facilitated new social divisions and fractured women's collective organizing. Second, it argues that while war creates certain opportunities for women, a revitalization of patriarchy in the aftermath can undermine these gains. Drawing on more than 250 interviews with women in both countries, this article ultimately questions the extent to which postwar mobilization can be maintained or harnessed for genuine gender emancipation.

College women (N = 435) read a sexually aggressive scenario and rated their intentions to engage in assertive, polite, and passive behavioral responses. Results indicated secondary cognitive appraisals predicted less assertive, more polite, and more passive responses. Good self-control predicted assertive and polite responses, while sexual assault history and poor regulation predicted passive responses. Poor regulation significantly moderated the relationship between secondary cognitive appraisals and passive behavioral responses. Implications for the prevention of sexual assault are discussed.

We analyze the ways that male consumers decoded EOWF and the ways that EOWF, as a sexual script, was included in the men's accounts of their sexual desires and practices. The majority of the men decoded EOWF through the preferred (encoded) meaning as an act of male dominance and sexual aggression and that they wanted to engage in it despite their general belief that women would not be interested in it.

The Representation of Teen Dating Violence in Young Adult Literature and Its Implications for Prevention	VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN			English	Article						teen dating violence; young adult literature; framing theory; media representations; prevention	INTIMATE PARTNER VIOLENCE; DOMESTIC VIOLENCE; SEXUAL ASSAULT; ROMANTIC RELATIONSHIPS; PUBLIC-HEALTH; ADOLESCENT; WOMEN; PERPETRATION; US; VICTIMIZATION	Teen dating violence (TDV) is a significant public health issue. Preventing TDV requires attention to risk and protective factors across ecological system levels. The media is one of the primary cultural drivers of societal-level social scripts about the causes of TDV. Framing theory asserts that the media's portrayal of social issues, including what contextual information is included and/or excluded, affects individual-level attitudes about TDV and potential policy responses. This study investigates the representation of TDV in young adult (YA) literature, a media genre that is marketed to adolescent audiences. Data include all YA novels (N = 8) that have a primary focus on TDV. Texts were analyzed systematically using thematic content analysis methods. Results indicate that the antecedents of TDV were portrayed as being related to victim personal characteristics such as inexperience in relationships and low self-esteem. Rather than underscoring how societal-level factors contribute to TDV, perpetration was seen as stemming from family dysfunction and mental health issues. These results underscore how the structural determinants of TDV have been overshadowed in the media's portrayal of TDV, in favor of narrow portrayals of victimization and perpetration. Implications for TDV prevention programs including the importance of media literacy are discussed.

Status inconsistency theory suggests that the higher incomes and female independence that may occur with microfinance participation may threaten or destabilize marital norms in Bangladesh, and have implications in terms of increased violence. We use qualitative data from in-depth interviews with 30 women residing in a slum in Dhaka, Bangladesh, to assess the circumstances in which there may be an association between microfinance participation and marital violence and elucidate the context in which this interaction occurs.

Current physical or sexual violence was associated with the highest likelihood of reporting health outcomes, followed by current emotional or economic abuse. Current controlling behavior increased the odds of reporting poor health whereas previous controlling behavior has less effect on current health. Controlling behavior alone often is the first expression of mistreatment. If health professionals could identify violence at this early stage, long-term effects on women's health could be minimized. The implications for health of the cumulative effects of violence and of its timing are discussed.

The issues are engaged through three distinct but overlapping conceptualisations of 'presence'. 'Presence' as conceived (and highly contested) in performance studies; 'presence' as conceived and worked with in psychoanalysis; and 'presence' as decolonising political praxis among Indigenous communities. I use these conceptualisations of presence to consider the various ways in which the black woman as figure and as embodied/sentient subject has been made present/absent in different discursive registers. I also explore what is foreclosed and how this is itself linked to legacies of colonial 'worlding'. I end with consideration of alternative modes of black women's presence and how this offers a resource for new modes of sociality.

J	Lisiak, A				Lisiak, Agata			other mothers: encountering in/visible femininities in migration and urban contexts	FEMINIST REVIEW			English	Article						femininity; migration; motherhood; encounters with diversity; urban space; class; whiteness	DIVERSITY; MIGRANTS; CULTURE	Whereas much has been written about migrants' visibility, the multiple and complex layers of migrants' invisibility invite further exploration. Migrants' in/visibility is not clear-cut: it differs across various locations and, as such, demands a comparative, intersectional analysis. This paper seeks to explore it by investigating how recent migrants make sense of their own appearance, as well as those of others they encounter in their new places of residence. Specifically, I inquire into the notion of femininity as it is performed and perceived by Polish migrant mothers living in German and British cities. I discuss whose performances of femininity are visible and whose femininity is rendered invisible in the eyes of my research participants, and what implications this may carry for urban and migration research. Strikingly, the women I interviewed only seem to recognise white British and German women's performances of femininity for what they are. Non-white and Muslim femininities remain, at best, invisible or, in the not infrequent cases of racism and Islamophobia, are stripped not only of their unique gendered features, but of humanity altogether. As seemingly peaceful interactions in urban space do not exclude privately harboured racial, ethnic, religious and class prejudice, a feminist revision of encounters with diversity provides valuable insight into the structure of such metropolitan paradoxes, yielding new understandings of how racism, classism and sexism persist alongside ostensibly inclusive urban cultures.

J	Mattoscio, M				Mattoscio, Mara			what's in a face?: Sara Baartman, the (post) colonial gaze and the case of Venus Noire (2010)	FEMINIST REVIEW			English	Article						Sara Baartman; Abdellatif Kechiche; Gilles Deleuze; voyeuristic gaze; postcolonial film; freak show	HOTTENTOT VENUS; FEMINISM; BODIES	The story of Sara Baartman, who was brought to Europe in 1810 to be exhibited as the erotic-exotic freak 'Hottentot Venus', is arguably the most famous case study of the scientific validation of (gendered) racism. Her scientific examination and post-mortem dissection by Georges Cuvier, who looked for an alleged connection between the Khoisan and the orangutan, have been the object of famous critical works (Gilman, 1985; Haraway, 1989; Fausto-Sterling, 1995), but also exposed her to the unpalatable fate of becoming the 'quintessential' figure of intersecting gender and racial oppressions. This paper deals with Abdellatif Kechiche's film Venus Noire (2010), which interestingly rearticulates the (in) famous narrative in unexpected ways. Shot by a male director who is also a postcolonial subject, the film exposes the performativity not only of gender and racial identities, but also of science theorisation, while at the same time raising the issue of whether exposing a violent male colonial gaze on a heavily exhibited woman can contribute to a counter-knowledge of her experience or rather risks reiterating the historical violence. The startling dynamic between the portrayed abuse and Kechiche's peculiar filmic strategies is the crucial focus of this paper. While Sara's body is continually exposed and violated, Venus Noire relies on her face, shot in recurrent extreme close ups, as a haunting presence potentially exceeding violence. Drawing on Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari's (1987 [1980]) account of the close up, I explore how Kechiche's take on Sara's face builds a strong connection with the spectator's extra-filmic dimension. As a case of what Deleuze and Guattari call a 'reflective face', such close ups invest the viewer with the ethical responsibility of being complicit in the othering practices of (post) colonial times. Venus Noire thus manages to engage the spectator's own corporeal awareness of violence, and calls attention to the persisting exploitation of sexual and racial colonial tropes in the contemporary world.									62	0	0	0	0	PALGRAVE MACMILLAN LTD	BASINGSTOKE	BRUNEL RD BLDG, HOUNDMILLS, BASINGSTOKE RG21 6XS, HANTS, ENGLAND	0141-7789	1466-4380		FEMINIST REV	Fem.

J	Kamin, T; Vezovnik, A				Kamin, Tanja; Vezovnik, Andreja			Slovenia's socialist superwoman: feeding the family, nourishing the nation	FEMINIST REVIEW			English	Article						socialism; Yugoslavia; lifestyle magazine; food; consumption; state feminism	WOMENS MAGAZINES; STATE; YUGOSLAVIA; FEMINISM; GENDER	This article explores how the Slovenian women's lifestyle magazine Nasa zena (Our Woman) helped the Yugoslavian socialist project construct and shape the ideal socialist woman, and argues that she became the crucial ally in implementing socialist ideas in the everyday lives of Slovenians. The article shows how texts on food preparation and consumption, as well as those touching on household management and family care, published in Nasa zena from 1960 to 1991 played an important part in the 'civilising' process that shaped behaviour, directed cultural and social practices, influenced social relations and constructed women's identities during socialism. We show how food-related texts (articles, recipes, columns, advertisements and advertorials) were never far removed from the larger political and economic socialist realities. In fact, they bore witness to changes in living standards and told stories about gender regimes, socialist ideologies and fantasies. These texts belong to a corpus of social transcripts that guide collective understandings of what it means to select, prepare, cook and eat food; what constitutes good cooking and eating; and who is responsible for preparing meals. Despite official socialist feminist rhetoric about freeing women from backward patriarchal arrangements, this article shows that texts offering food-related advice in socialist Yugoslavia contained explicit instructions for the 'correct' performance of the social roles of women, legitimising women's roles as worker, mother, wife and housekeeper. Above all, a woman was to be an 'engineer' of the private domain whose goals were to feed her family and keep the nation healthy and hence productive, and to modernise her kitchen in support of the technological and economic development of Yugoslavia.

J	Fisher, J				Fisher, Jeremy			gendering markets, gendering food: women, law and markets in the New York City food system, 1800-1840	FEMINIST REVIEW			English	Article						gender; law; markets; food	GUILDS; PARTICIPATION; ENGLAND; ECONOMY; REFORM; FAMILY	The history of market regulations provides an important perspective on the gendering of systems of food within the evolution of urban economies. This article addresses an important and distinctive period in this process, when New York shifted away from colonial and English-derived institutions in the first four decades of the nineteenth century. The legal status of women was unsettled during this time, introducing uncertainty into women's economic activities. New York City's public marketplaces were carefully regulated through a network of ancient and sometimes arcane laws that inscribed particular activities within well-defined spaces while prohibiting them elsewhere. While these laws were derived from traditional English practices, enforcement was becoming increasingly legalistic rather than customary. While these market laws did not specifically invoke gender, they produced a system that was less navigable to women due to their problematic status as legal subjects. Because the system's navigability differed by commodity, these laws significantly shaped the gendered identity of foodstuffs, such as meat and fruit. Carefully delineating these legal constructions allows us to better understand how women navigated the real and conceptual spaces of the food system, and to see how the changing legal realities of New York impinged on women's employment.

J	Jabiri, A				Jabiri, Afaf			gendered politics of alienation and power restoration: Arab revolutions and women's sentiments of loss and despair	FEMINIST REVIEW			English	Article						gender normativity; regime restoration; revolution; alienation; women; activism		From the start of the Arab revolutions in late 2010, a connection between the law, state, political economy, gender norms and orientalist ideology has formed the foundation of women's systematic exclusion from politics. By unmasking processes in Egypt that have created the ideological and material conditions of externalising women's revolutionary acts, estranging their political involvement, and exposing them to various forms of violence, this article offers a gendered political reading of the concept of alienation. The article suggests that gender-normative ideology's characterisation of women's images, roles and acts during and after revolutions, corresponds to the most profound form of alienation. The article identifies the externalisation and subjugation of women, and objectification of their revolutionary acts as modes of alienation. Moreover, it proposes that the implementing of these modes of alienation are necessary for creating conditions that allow for the reconfiguration of power dynamics that restore the authoritarian power of the state. This discussion suggests that the sphere of politics not only relates to political activism and conflict between revolutions and counter-revolutions, but that it is also a battlefield for the (re) production of gender-normative knowledge.

J	Lilja, M				Lilja, Mona			layer-cake figurations and hide-and-show resistance in Cambodia	FEMINIST REVIEW			English	Article						hide-and-show resistance; layer-cake figurations; female politicians; Cambodia	HIDDEN POPULATIONS; WORLD	This article adds to previous research, by connecting the concept of resistance to practices of self-making and the embodying of various gendered images. In this article, I advance that women politicians, activists and NGO workers in Cambodia, who seem to repeat and maintain established gender discourses, actually use these discourses and the existence of a multilayered figuration as a 'hiding place'. This can be understood as various gendered discourses and figurations being utilised as resistance. In order to further explore this pattern, the article introduces the concepts of hide-and-show resistance and layer-cake figurations. The notion of figurations, as situated and culturally differentiated, becomes an important starting point, displaying resistance that originates from the way we are constituted in a local-transnational, material and fast-changing world.

Based on qualitative research we conducted in Diyarbakir, Istanbul, London, and Berlin in 2015-16, we show that Kurdish activists have struggled to make the eradication of gender-based inequalities and violence central to the wider Kurdish peace movement, while Turkish women's rights activists have increasingly recognized that the war against the Kurds, "like a blanket," often papers over gender injustices. Both Kurdish and Turkish activists stress the necessity of understanding that a just and sustainable peace must include gender equality and that gender justice cannot be achieved in times of war. Thus feminist convergences in Kurdish and Turkish activism present peace and women's rights as inseparable and generate the potential to challenge nationalist state power and the militarization of society.

Theft by women was typically an isolated act motivated by urban conditions of poverty, but many women became skilled repeat offenders who worked individually or in teams, taking advantage of the growing transportation networks that linked villages, towns, and cities. The theft examined includes shoplifting, pickpocketing, burglary, laundry stealing, scams, and stealing from domestic employers. Given their low wages, poor and working-class women had difficulty meeting their material needs in a semicolonial capitalist urban economy even when they worked in legal occupations. In addition, the legal work most available to them, in factories or as domestic servants, violated classed and gendered notions of respectability. Theft offered the possibility of material gain without great loss in status if one were captured, since poor and working-class women who lived in Egypt's growing cities between the two world wars already had difficulty measuring up to the standards of being mastura,a morally and sexually protected member of society.

J	Feldman, RZ				Feldman, Rachel Z.			Putting Messianic Femininity into Zionist Political Action The Race-Class and Ideological Normativity of Women for the Temple in Jerusalem	JOURNAL OF MIDDLE EAST WOMENS STUDIES			English	Article						messianism; gender; race		The movement to rebuild the Third Jewish Temple on the Temple Mount/Haram ash-Sharif in Jerusalem has grown significantly since 2000. The Orthodox Jewish "Women for the Temple" group has come to play a central role in this activism. Women for the Temple activists perform a messianic femininity that emphasizes maternal duties and women's redemptive power in Judaism while challenging male religious authorities and religious law in other areas. Activists define themselves as guardians of domestic space and the House of God (the future Third Temple) and redeemers of the Jewish nation. This project simultaneously empowers women and enables state violence against Palestinians on Haram ash-Sharif. Scholarship that has examined Israel's messianic right-wing women's activism has overlooked their Ashkenazi whiteness and their middle-class privileged status in Israel. The race-class normativity of Women for the Temple allows them to access resources and police protection and facilitates the mainstreaming of the Third Temple movement.

Two empirical case studies are presented to assess the current dynamics of rural women's land title rights in coffee agroforestry under Colombia's new Formalizacion Propiedad Rural program, and indigenous Quechua women's communal forest land rights for indigenous foods like kanawa and quinoa farming in highland Bolivia. In doing so, it also gives an introduction to the five empirical research papers that are part of this Special Section edited by the author. The specific case studies are from the Brazilian Amazon, Bolivia's Gran Chaco area, Nicaragua's indigenous territories and two studies from Mexico - one from Oaxaca's central valley and the other is based on smallholder farming in Calakmul rural area. In conclusion, the author discusses the need to prioritise women's role in individual land rights and communal forest tenure in Latin American countries.

J	Radel, C; Schmook, B; Haenn, N; Green, L				Radel, Claudia; Schmook, Birgit; Haenn, Nora; Green, Lisa			The gender dynamics of conditional cash transfers and smallholder farming in Calakmul, Mexico	WOMENS STUDIES INTERNATIONAL FORUM			English	Article						Gender; Intra-household resource management; Maize; Oportunidades; Women's empowerment	LABOR MIGRATION; LATIN-AMERICA; AGRICULTURE; CAMPECHE; EXPERIENCE; LAND; GAP	We explore how Oportunidades, Mexico's anti-poverty conditional cash transfer (CCT) program, impacts production and gender dynamics in the smallholder agricultural sector. A 2010 household survey in one southeastern municipality (Calakmul) captured data on Oportunidades receipt, land use and yields, as well as gendered patterns of asset control, decision-making, labor, and income receipt. Our analysis suggests that households with Oportunidades are more likely to engage in semi-subsistence maize cultivation and on average harvest more maize. Thus Oportunidades appears to support semi-subsistence production. We also document persistent gender gaps in land control, decision-making, labor, and income receipt. Nonetheless, we find that households with Oportunidades have on average smaller gaps of particular kinds: women receiving Oportunidades are more likely to hold de jure land rights and to share in income receipt from four main crops. These effects of Oportunidades on gendered smallholder production dynamics are important ones in smallholder women's lives. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

We explore a very specific effect of women's empowerment on efforts to implement more sustainable livelihood practices by women participating in collective microenterprise activities. The study used a qualitative research design, carrying out semi-structured interviews with 65 rural women participants of eleven collective microenterprises in the Amazonian states of Para and Acre, Brazil. The results showed that women's economic empowerment contributed to their strengthened capacity for adaptive governance in the household due to improvements in their awareness of environmental issues and practices used to manage forest resources; and greater access to resources and to decision-making power about land use.

Methods include a survey, focus groups, participant observation and adaptive collaborative management processes over a two-year period. Results revealed that while a higher percentage of men than women participate in the harvest of eight forest products, women participate substantially in product sales and have some control over income. A majority of men and women believe that women participate in decision-making, but that participation was of low efficacy. Women face significant obstacles to effective participation in forest decision-making in the community: weak community organization, pressure by spouses, difficulty organizing among themselves and informal sanctions. Improving meaningful participation of women in decision-making requires addressing challenges and obstacles at multiple levels; obstacles at the communal level, where the future of the forests will be decided, cannot be overcome without attention to the household.

Briq., a multi-purpose Non Timber Forest Product used as ornament, food or medicine in western and central Mexico. Research was conducted in San Miguel Mixtepec, a Zapotec community of Oaxaca's Central Valleys. Drawing on the literature on governance, forests and gender rights, the paper aims at answering the following questions: who gets to make poleo access, use and management rules? How does gender ideology shape these rules? Whose knowledge (men's, women's, both) takes precedence in poleo decision-making? What is the relationship between these rules and governance efficiency? Results show that poleo harvesting practices are regulated by male-dominated institutions that do not grant rights to women. Female plant uses remain unaccounted for, in spite of the fact that they are more varied than men's. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The interviews that became the basis of this research were done only for the psychological support of the women staying at the Diyarbakir Refugee Camp in Turkey between January and March 2015. This research was shaped with aim of understanding the women, sharing their experiences, and being these women's voices, therefore the interviews given by Yezidi women were evaluated with grounded theory methodology. Coping strategies included gratitude for surviving, finding meaning for massacres, politization, being self-enclosed, mourning rituals and worship, strengthening women's solidarity, and showing solidarity with sexually attacked women through silence. War trauma reactions included mental unpreparedness, the sense of being betrayed, verbalization about the genocide (but not the sexual attacks), re-experiencing the trauma and mood changes.

Drawing on in-depth interviews with 17 breastfeeding women from middle-Tennessee, this study examines maternal sexuality through the negotiation of their gendered embodiment as mothers and lovers during lactation. Contributing to the growing literature that marks father support as central to breastfeeding outcomes, this study explores the dimension of maternal sexuality to clarify the role of father influence. Participants attest to the complexities of maternal performativity as they regulate their behavior in response to the presence of men when breastfeeding in public, coupled with the experience of interrupted intimacy with their partners. The participants' experiences highlight the dilemma of maternal sexuality as women struggle with the sexual fluidity of their breasts in social and intimate contexts.

Many analyses put forth various factors that explain the variation in wages across genders. However, we extend this knowledge to link the gender wage gap with the theoretical framework of intersectionality. Specifically, the current analysis focuses on the intersection between gender, race, and region to explain the variation in gender wage gap across the United States. Through difference in means tests as well as linear regression, we show that region has an independent effect on explaining the gap in pay between men and women. We employ data from the National Women's Law Center that quantifies the wage gap for each state for various racial groups. By employing this type of data, it allows us to move beyond the existence of the wage gap and analyze the effect of region as well as offer a test of the intersectionality argument. Findings show that region does play a role in the wage gap, even when accounting for economic and demographic characteristics of the state.

The children, Domenic and Gemini, died of dehydration and starvation. Charged with two counts of second-degree homicide, Fujii plead guilty to manslaughter and received an 8-year sentence. Through an analysis of the publicly available judicial documents relating to the crimes of Rie Fujii, this paper explores how the law's individualization and medicalization of crime and violence may obscure the multiple forms of everyday and structural violence that racialized women in white settler states such as Canada experience and may perpetrate. Drawing on Scheper-Hughes and Bourgois' concept of the violence continuum, I argue that the law's conceptualization of crime and violence conceals and thus advances the violence endemic to white settler colonialism.

I examine the treatment of the disappeared and deceased Magdalen women in the economic and political context of the Irish use of religious institutions and consider the significance of this regime for women's citizenship in the postcolonial nation-building processes of the twentieth century. I aim to illustrate the connections between gender, violence and citizenship that are implicated in outcomes for justice for Magdalen survivors and victims, as well as conceptions of Irish women's citizenship in general. In this discussion I consider the Magdalen campaigns for justice as significant for the individual women and families involved, as well as the entire nation's conception of self as represented in history.

In September 2012 after 47 years of alleged abuse, Frenchwoman Jacqueline Sauvage fatally shot her abusive husband three times in the back. The subsequent contested trial, conviction for murder, unsuccessful appeal and later presidential pardon of Sauvage thrust the French law of self-defence into the spotlight. The Sauvage case raises important questions surrounding the adequacy of the French criminal law in this area, the ongoing proliferation of gendered stereotypes in law and the need for reform. In the wake of the Sauvage case, this article provides a timely analysis of the gendered law of self-defence in France. Drawing from an in-depth analysis of the judgments imposed in the Sauvage case, this article examines the adequacy of French legal responses to battered women who kill and ignites an argument for further law reform.

J	Hodgson, N				Hodgson, Natalie			Gender Justice or Gendered Justice? Female Defendants in International Criminal Tribunals	FEMINIST LEGAL STUDIES			English	Article						Defendants; Gender; Gender justice; International criminal justice; Women	WOMEN; CHALLENGES; SITE; WAR; LAW	Recent scholarship has given increasing attention to studying women's involvement in conflict and mass violence. However, there is comparatively less discussion of the experiences of women as actors and perpetrators in conflict, and limited discussion of women as defendants in international criminal tribunals. This article explores this under-researched area. By analysing legal materials from the cases of six female defendants, this article investigates the extent to which legal discourses are shaped by stereotypes regarding femininity, conflict and peace. It identifies three gender narratives-mothers, monsters and wives-used in relation to female defendants, which highlight the incompatibility of femininity with violence, and deny women's agency in political and military contexts. Thus, this article concludes that female defendants in international criminal tribunals are viewed through gendered lenses, and discussed in accordance with gendered themes. This gendered justice is problematic, as it reinforces patriarchal gender stereotypes, and may hinder attempts to facilitate gender justice.

I selected three photographs for my FLaK zine and called them 'unwanted girls', 'battered wives' and 'inglorious women'. To examine the relevance of the proverb in Modern China, I will discuss three women-related problems behind these photographs and analyse their cultural and legal causes. By doing so, I aim to achieve two purposes-first, to help the reader have a better understanding of the problems of women in the region where one-fifth of the global population lives, and second, to argue that seemingly gender neutral law and policy can produce new and greater restrictions on women's freedom.

The increased participation of British South Asian women in higher education has been hailed as a major success story and is said to have enabled them to forge alternative, more empowering gender identities in comparison to previous generations. Drawing on generative narrative interviews conducted with three young women, we explore the under-researched area of Pakistani Muslim women in higher education. The central plotlines for their stories are respectively higher education as an escape from conforming to the good Muslim woman; becoming an educated mother; and Muslim women can have it all. Although the women narrated freedom to choose, their stories were complex. Through analysis of personal I and social We self-narration, we discuss the different ways in which they drew on agency and fashioned it within social and structural constraints of gender, class and religion. Thus, higher education is a context that both enables and constrains negotiations of identity.

"Living for others": Narrating agency in the context of failed marriages and singleness in urban Sri Lanka	FEMINISM & PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						agency; marriage; single women; narrative; critical discursive psychology; interpretive repertoire; subject position; ideological dilemma	WOMENS NARRATIVES; MOTHERHOOD; CHOICE	Marriage is a cultural imperative in Sri Lanka and is constructed as the principal source of personal fulfilment for women. This paper critically examines through two case studies - a never-married woman and a woman in a failed marriage - how women from older generations narrate their life histories using culturally coherent repertoires. By deconstructing the subject positions of the long-suffering wife, the devoted mother, and the selfless woman, I reveal the spaces for manoeuvre these women create to experience well-being and exercise agency outside of the culture's hegemonic narrative of successful marriage and maternity. Using the life history narratives I challenge the tendency to imagine older women's lives as more constrained and illustrate the ways in which equivocal narratives about independence and self-sacrifice, about freedom and suffering simultaneously conceal agency while allowing non-normative ways of being.

This paper explores the experiences of a young woman who sought to have sex with someone new in order to move on from the breakup of a long-term relationship. This case study is part of a larger project which explored how young people (aged 18-25) negotiate their love/sex relationships within the context of new media environments. While this young woman described her experience of having sex with someone new as empowering, within a neoliberal, postfeminist context the concept of empowerment may not be a useful theoretical tool for understanding young women's sexuality. Situating her story within its broader sociocultural context, this paper explores how structural factors shape this young woman's ability to navigate normative discourses about sexual empowerment and construct herself as a sexual subject.

Using an intersectional approach, we explore in this study how young women's smoking is implicated in the doing and undoing of femininities, as well as other intersecting identities. Discourse analysis was used to examine interviews and a photography activity conducted with young women, both current and ex-smokers. This analysis revealed four culturally dominant repertoires: cigarettes and smoking styles as gendered, smoking as controlling weight, smoking as a sexual tool, and smoking as compromising appearance. Young women's experiences and negotiations of discourse surrounding smoking and femininity were shaped by intersecting social class and sexual identities. These findings can be used to inform the development of smoking cessation interventions which recognise the diversity in how young women perform femininity.

J	Chadwick, R				Chadwick, Rachelle			Ambiguous subjects: Obstetric violence, assemblage and South African birth narratives	FEMINISM & PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						childbirth; obstetric violence; assemblage; intersectionality; agency; South Africa; narrative	MATERNITY CARE; HEALTH-CARE; CHILDBIRTH; ABUSE; EXPERIENCES; WOMEN; PERCEPTIONS; REFLECTIONS; DISRESPECT; LABOR	Obstetric violence is gaining recognition as a worldwide problem manifesting in a range of geopolitical contexts. While global public health attention is turning to this issue, there has been a lack of theoretical engagement by feminist psychologists with the phenomenon of obstetric violence. This paper contributes to the literature on obstetric violence via a feminist social constructionist analysis of marginalized and low-income South African women's narratives of giving birth in public sector obstetric contexts. Drawing on interviews conducted in 2012 with 35 black, low-income women living in Cape Town, South Africa, the analysis focuses on obstetric violence as a relational, disciplinary, and productive process that has implications for the construction of women's subjectivities and agency during childbirth. The findings focus on relational constructions of violence and agency in women's narratives, including (a) the performance of docility as an act of ambiguous agency and (2) resistant bodies and modes of discipline. Framed within a Foucauldian approach to power and using the concept of assemblage, I argue that obstetric violence needs to be conceptualized as more than isolated acts involving individual perpetrators and victims. Instead, the analysis shows that obstetric violence functions as a mode of discipline embedded in normative relations of class, gender, race, and medical power.

Women's genital body work: Health, hygiene and beauty practices in the production of idealized female genitalia	FEMINISM & PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						vaginal practices; genital hygiene; female genitalia; body work; women's health; microbiome; douching	HAIR REMOVAL; VAGINAL DISCHARGE; GENDER; SATISFACTION; PERCEPTIONS; ATTITUDES; AGENCY; IMAGE	Women's genitalia are constructed as a bodily site requiring ongoing surveillance, maintenance and modification to conform to social norms. Women engage in a range of genital health, hygiene and beauty practices, including the use of commercial and homemade vaginal douches, washes, wipes, sprays and pubic hair removal, to modify their bodies. Using a social constructionist framework, we draw on interviews with 49 Canadian women to examine the construction of idealized (Western) genitalia as hairless, odourless and free of discharge, and natural female genitalia as problematic through the mobilization of normative femininity and (hetero)sexuality discourses. Theorizing women's genital health, hygiene and beauty practices as a form of body work, we examine how women's genital body work is constructed as a necessary and thus normative practice of femininity undertaken in the pursuit of idealized genitalia. A minority perspective that drew on alternative discourses to construct female genitalia as acceptable irrespective of genital body work is examined. Throughout our analysis, we examine the ways in which women negotiate issues of agency and choice in relation to their genital body work. Implications for women's health in the context of the vaginal microbiome are explored.

The article focuses on the qualitative aspect of the study in which 59 women were interviewed individually before and/or after their counselling. The interviews explored how women make sense of long-term counselling in the context of their gendered experiences and complex needs. The data were analysed using thematic analysis informed by a feminist orientation and attachment theory. Four main themes emerged: violence and loss in the context of female oppression, a sanctuary for women, non-medicalised long-term counselling in a safe setting, and benefits of the long view. Participants attributed various benefits to receiving long-term counselling in a women-only environment. These included gaining employment; reduced suicidal ideation, anxiety and depression; improved physical health, improved confidence and being able to make positive changes in their relationships. The women interviewed post-counselling valued long-term counselling in this context, in contrast to short-term therapy in a medicalised environment. Wider implications with regard to clinical practice and research are discussed.

This report was prompted by the discrepancy between problematic representations of women observed in online gaming community discussions of these issues and women's rich and complex accounts of their gameplay. Poststructural theory facilitated exploration of the construction of women gamers as important in the reproduction of and resistance to problematic gendered discourses. Analysis illustrates the politics of (in)visibility that women gamers negotiate: limited possibilities for women as active subjects and little recognition of women's desires in gaming motivations. Findings highlight a need to engage with both the re-inscription of women as denoting a secondary status and the poverty of discursive resources available in discussion of these issues for transforming existing understandings.

J	Ugur Tanriover, H				Tanriover, Hulya Ugur			Women as film directors in Turkish cinema	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF WOMENS STUDIES			English	Article						Film industry; gender and cinema; gender stereotypes and film narratives; women's employment in Turkey; women's film festivals		Representations of women, or more exactly of gender, and the presence and works of women filmmakers constitute an important area of analysis for gender studies and feminist film theories. In Turkey the presence and the participation of women in the public sphere have been one of the important objectives of the Kemalist modernization project since the founding of the modern nation-state in 1923. However, despite the modernizing efforts to empower women in different spheres of life there was no woman director in Turkish commercial feature cinema until the beginning of the 1950s. Since the beginning of the 2000s the number of women directors has increased significantly, reaching a number well above that of the entire period before. This article investigates the reasons behind this increase based on quantitative data gathered from secondary sources and in-depth interviews with women producers and directors. It also questions whether and to what extent the increase in the number of women film directors contributed to the production of women's films', based on a qualitative analysis of films produced by women directors between the years 2004 and 2013. The results show that in addition to technological and aesthetic changes in the industry, the increase in the availability of international and national public funding for low-budget independent film productions and the enlargement of the women's movement allowed more women directors to enter the film industry. While half of the films made by women directors in the 2000s could be qualified as women films', the other half remained, largely due to market forces, within the conventions of popular or art house cinema.

J	Jansson, M				Jansson, Maria			Gender equality in Swedish film policy: Radical interpretations and "unruly' women	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF WOMENS STUDIES			English	Article						Film policy; gender equality; gender quotas; governance; representation; representational claims	MUSLIM WOMEN; DEMOCRACY; SECURITY; POLITICS; QUOTAS	Gender quotas have been a crucial part of Swedish film policy since 2006 and have resulted in an increasing number of films with women directors, producers and screenwriters. However, films with women directors are still likely to have smaller budgets and less money for marketing and distribution than films with men directors. This article suggests that, in the context of film governance, gender quotas are discursively constructed in ways that circumscribe the opportunities to change current gender relations. Nevertheless, gender quotas have been used as a springboard for more radical interpretations to improve women's conditions and challenge the foundation of the governance regime. The article also explores the idea that bottom-up representational claims are necessary to ensure that quotas and the inclusion of women result in women's voices being heard. Such measures require the governance regime to be sensitive to voices that deviate from the norm.

Disentangling "new femininities' under neoliberal conditions	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF WOMENS STUDIES			English	Article						Aspiration; failure; feminism; social class; sociology; women	POST-FEMINIST; YOUNG-WOMEN; TIMES; STRUGGLES; EQUALITY; GIRLS	This article critically examines what might be titled the feminisation of success that is ascribed to optimistic characterisations of new constructions of femininity for young women in the UK, particularly in relation to classed positions. In order to do this it is necessary to understand the complex relationship between feminism, post-feminism, neoliberalism and femininities, especially since the millennium. Young women have been positioned as the beneficiaries of successful social and political change which, together with ideas of individualism and reflexive constructions of identity, almost mandate young women to embody success. The article seeks to examine and assess the discursive constructions of successful femininities' in relation to their normative limitations and asks in particular whether the putative existence of new femininities' is attainable for all young women. With the impact of over a decade of neoliberal policies and austerity measures being felt by many, it is argued that the discourses of successful femininities' work to obscure the recalibrated inequalities that have been forged by neoliberal conditions.

J	Venalainen, S				Venalainen, Satu			Conversations with otherness: Violence and womanhood in narratives of women imprisoned for violent crimes	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF WOMENS STUDIES			English	Article						Affect; discourse; positioning; violence; womanhood	STEREOTYPES; GENDER	Widely circulated cultural conceptions about women who have committed violence recurrently place them in positions of otherness in relation to what is considered as being normal, valuable womanhood. This article explores ways in which Finnish women imprisoned for violent crimes grapple with this troubled relation between womanhood and violence in their enactments of gendered identities. The analysis is based on a novel, discursive-affective approach to positioning that can accommodate complexity and context-specific variability in enactments of identities. Four different, recurring modes of positioning are discussed in the analysis: aligning with forcefulness, aligning with vulnerability, (dis)-aligning with demonization and aligning with motherhood. By shedding light not only on the complexity and fluidity of these gendered identity enactments but also on their affectively ambivalent dimensions, the analysis contributes to attempts at countering reductionist views about women who have committed violence and the gendered dichotomizations that they work to reproduce.

The few Spanish studies on this issue have focused on double discrimination, instead we propose intersectionality as a more suitable epistemological framework. The research, carried out in Spain, is based on five life stories of disabled activist women which show us how heteropatriarchal and ableist violence intersect in their lives, and the resistance mechanisms that they develop to deal with it. This research gives important clues to plan and design effective interventions for and with disabled women.

The experience becomes complex when confronted in a different country, especially for Spanish-speaking Latina immigrants, representing a challenge in their path to survival. This ethnographic study was based in Chicana feminism and Mujerismo epistemology. From the Mujerista framework arises the concept of permitanme hablar and la lucha, which emphasizes the importance of the women's narratives from their own contexts. Consequently, the need of reclaiming from their stories alternative forms of intervention by service providers and those who develop programs as well as social policies in favor of their communities.

Transition House has survived and is, today, a thriving agency. Based on interviews with and papers collected from those involved in founding and running it, as well as a few guests/clients, I argue that Transition House's evolution was impelled by three major forces shared with other early domestic violence agencies: changes in the culture due in part to successes of the battered women's movement in the early years, changes in the larger political-economic context due to national policies and economic trends, which make getting out of poverty in 2017 more difficult than it was in the 1970s, and learning from survivors and from evolving research on domestic violence. In 1976, the immediate focus was on women battered by their partners, and the agency was strongly identified with the women's movement. In 2017, the focus is on women who are battered by economic and social conditions as much as by their partners, and the agency is seen as a partner with the city and with other nonprofit agencies.

Ordained Hindu women believed that commitment to religious orders, celibacy, and social service countered patriarchy. City location, work profile versatility in the order, education, and duration of being ordained, significantly influenced their views and scores on the Feminist Perspective Scale and Public Service Motivation Scale. Two implications are foregrounded: the recognition of a cohort of women who perform social service as religious duty, and a different form of feminist care ethics located within a feminist theological premise.

Interpretive interactionist analysis of in-depth interviews with 13 nonresidential mothers identified the discursive strategies that they used to negotiate a troubled maternal identity due to their nonnormative position. The mothers deflected guilt and responsibility for the fact that they do not live with their children. Further, they exhibited two dynamics of maternal identity construction: internalizing the critical discourse and constructing a nonresidential identity as a good enough mother. The findings support the view that hegemonic social discourses affect the construction of maternal identity by nonresidential mothers. At the same time, they are also indicative of the creation of an alternative discourse that portrays a nonresidential maternal identity as positive.

The data analyzed consist of focus group sessions with 11 professionals within social and youth work. The findings revealed that violence is conceptualized through interpretative repertoires as social functionality, psychological functionality, or dysfunctionality, which affect the professionals' conceptualizations of violence and social work practice. Accordingly, a multifaceted understanding of violence is needed, otherwise girls' and young women's violent acts risk being diminished and made into an individual problem to solved.

The lack of a universally available policy drives women out of the paid labor force, with a disproportionate impact on low-income women. In this article, I illuminate the mechanisms by which structural inequality reproduces class inequality across the transition to motherhood. Between 2012 and 2015, I interviewed 44 first-time mothers from diverse class backgrounds. From their narratives, I identify three typologies of working womenprofessional, pink-professional, and low-wage workersand show how formal workplace policies and informal practices, coupled with women's cultural knowledge, shape new mothers' employment trajectories when they have their first child. Policy makers and social workers serving new mothers need to be attuned to how women's occupational group may facilitate or inhibit access to parental leave, in order to pave the way for more equitable paid family leave for all women.

Miscarriage starts with a pregnancy, so a woman who has miscarried deals with many of the same workplace issues as women who carry to term. The experience of miscarriage, however, often leads to physical and emotional trauma and/or grief that many women hide from their co-workers. In this paper we also explore how secrecy is an integral part of the miscarriage experience. The combination of secrecy and grief that is layered on top of a difficult physical experience makes miscarriage a unique experience that, to date, has mostly been ignored in management literature and practice. It is well documented that contemporary corporate structures have little room for addressing procreation, health and grief, it is perhaps unsurprising then that despite miscarriage being seen as a relatively common event it remains silenced.

Yet, studies indicate that GM continues to be unevenly implemented, both within and across countries. To explain this outcome, this paper focuses on the local implementers of GM the gender focal points and how they understand GM and interpret it in their everyday work. Drawing upon interviews with gender focal points in the Canadian public service, we explore how bureaucratic role perceptions shape how these local actors understand GM and how they navigate the complex terrain between bureaucratic neutrality and the equality agenda of gender mainstreaming. Our exploratory study shows no common understanding among our interviewees, revealing how the meaning of gender mainstreaming varies depending on whether the public servant views himself or herself as policy analyst, policy advisor or policy advocate. Based on these insights, we conclude with suggestions for future research on gender mainstreaming.

Coupled with a decrease in caring for one's senior parents at home, this condition creates a crisis in elderly care. Most studies on elderly care in Japan, the country with the highest percentage of senior people in the world, employ theoretical approaches rooted in the fields of aging and migration studies. This article offers a new perspective by not only focusing on the voices of the Indonesian women migrant care workers in Japan by way of in-depth interviews, but also intersecting feminist and waste studies in its analysis. This different theoretical approach allows this article to argue that the politics of disposability in the global care chains' is a gendered and affective' phenomenon. Drawing from Jaggar's emotional hegemony' and Saraswati's affective structure', this article shows that emotions matter in constructing the disposability of these migrant workers and elderly people, particularly within the capitalist currents that drive the gendered supply chains.

This article considers how women in the gender-segregated informal economy construct their entrepreneurial identity in relation to mobile phones and the discursive repertoires that marginalize and empower. Using data from interviews with six urban female street traders in Kampala, Uganda, it explores how these repertoires illustrate their sense of self, positioning and belonging to the business community. Normative representations and positioning of female traders can sideline entrepreneurial identity and over-validate gender identity. But, participants also negotiate entrepreneurial identity construction in response to these marginalizing influences. Although the data demonstrate that participants are equivocal about their entrepreneurial identity or fit in business, some representations are more validating and offer a sense of belonging. The article concludes by highlighting the nuanced opportunities for social change their discursive repertoires may present.

The focus of this article is the writing of women themselves; to give voice to women's experiences as constructors of knowledge. Through so doing this article uses writing as praxis; as a mechanism to disrupt, challenge and open a space for renegotiation of cultural norms within academic institutions. Based on qualitative data collection over a six-year period, this article writes women's experiences and unpacks the way in which cultural sexism has become an ordinary feature of women's academic lives. It also considers ways in which the underlying cultural interpretations of hegemonic masculinized structures may be re-written.

This paper examines the implications of rehabilitation within Danish homecare work, a type of work that is often stigmatized due to its associations with low-status dirty' body work in old people's homes. The paper combines two research traditions: studies of dirty work and studies of body work. It draws on observations and focus groups in Denmark to explore how the introduction of rehabilitation changes the work of care workers, and how such changes are associated with a potential reshaping of stigma. In contrast to previous research, this paper shows that although rehabilitation was partly introduced to reduce stigma of this type of work, the practice of rehabilitation paradoxically reinforces the stigma that it attempts to manage. Thus, the analysis helps to improve our understanding of the ambiguous and varying ways rehabilitative eldercare reshapes and reinforces stigma and gender stereotypes among women who do dirty' body work.

Research suggests that sexual objectification has the ability to alter the way we perceive women. Objectification occurs, in part, because women's bodies pose a unique existential threat, and objectifying women is believed to mitigate concerns about mortality because it transforms women into something inanimate and thus less mortal. We therefore hypothesized that priming death concerns should impact object-person recognition of women. In the present study we recruited 177 undergraduate students from a U.S. Midwestern university to participate in exchange for course credit. We utilized face-morphing techniques to create a series of images representing a continuum of artificial-to-real faces, and after being exposed to a death reminder (as opposed to a pain reminder comparison condition), we asked participants to rate the extent to which the image appeared artificial. Results suggested that death awareness biases people towards reporting artificial female (but not male) faces as real. Existential concerns about death have an impact on perceptual assessments of women, specifically women who have been turned into literal objects. Future research directions, limitations of the current study, and implications for improving women's health and well-being with this added knowledge about objectification are discussed.

Based on a content analysis of a sample of 6286 profile photos drawn from online dating sites in seven countries (Austria, Denmark, Hungary, Japan, Netherlands, Sweden, and the United States) in 2013, we did not find any overall gender differences in facial prominence. However, further analysis showed gender differences in facial prominence for certain age groups: whereas there were no gender differences in the 25-41 year-old age group, young women between 18 and 24 had a higher facial prominence than men, and men older than 41 had higher facial prominence than women. These changes by age are driven by a pattern wherein facial prominence generally remains stable for men, but declines for women with age. In short, older users follow more traditional gender depictions in accordance with the face-ism phenomenon, whereas among younger people, women sport an even higher facial prominence than men do. In contrast to this significant interaction between gender and age in facial prominence, we found no significant interaction between culture (as measured by Hofstede's masculinity dimension) and gender, which indicates that culture plays no discernible role in gender differences in facial prominence, possibly because macro-level sexism (Hofstede's masculinity dimension) and micro-level sexism (photographs of individuals online) are not the same.

These diverse cultural narratives include: women are sexually passive, women should desire sex and be sexually empowered, and women are expected to navigate ambivalent societal messages regarding their sexuality. In our study, we explored how college-aged young women describe and understand their first exposure to a sexual image. This mixed methods study, guided by critical feminism, addresses how young women, reflecting on their experiences since girlhood, have navigated changing cultural standards for female sexuality in light of complex negotiations among varying expectations. We examined 445 young women's written reflections on seeing a sexual image for the first time. Most of the women reported that this experience occurred when they were in elementary school, and at home with friends, family, or alone. We found four themes of reactions to seeing the image for the first time: unwanted, intrigued, ambivalent, and neutral. Implications for comprehensive sex education include the need for teachers, parents, and other trusted adults to provide accurate and age-appropriate knowledge and opportunities for discussion about sexuality. Limitations and future directions are also discussed.

To date, however, no one has examined the content of Mainstream compared to Feminist pornography. The present content analysis of 300 pornographic scenes compares categories of internet pornography aimed at women (including Feminist and For Women) to Mainstream pornography, examining indicators of both sexual objectification (including stripping, cumshots, aggression, genital focus, and gaping) and agency (including self-touch, orgasm, and directing and initiating sex). Results suggest that Mainstream pornography contains significantly more depictions of female objectification than both Feminist and For Women content. There is an objectification gender gap between men and women in all categories, which is significantly wider in Mainstream content than in pornography aimed at women. Focusing on empowerment, queer Feminist pornography contained significantly more indicators of female sexual agency than both For Women and Mainstream categories, although primarily heterosexual Feminist pornography did not. Findings suggest that different categories of pornography provide women with different scripts related to sexual objectification, agency, and gender dynamics, which may impact sexual behavior.

Personality across Sexual Identity and Gender in a National Probability Sample in New Zealand	SEX ROLES			English	Article						Sexual identity; Personality; Gender; Gender inversion; Gender shift	MAJOR DIMENSIONS; UNITED-STATES; ORIENTATION; POPULATION; PREVALENCE; GAY; MINI-IPIP6; DISORDERS; BEHAVIOR; CULTURES	Preliminary evidence in online and convenience samples has shown small but significant personality differences across sexual identity and gender over a number of personality traits. The idea that gender intersects with sexual identity to affect personality has been formalized into two hypotheses: the gender inversion hypothesis (that lesbians and heterosexual men, as well as gay men and heterosexual women, have indistinguishable mean scores on personality traits) and the gender shift hypothesis (that gay men's and lesbians' personality scores fall somewhere between those of heterosexual women and men). We investigate personality differences in self-identified sexual identity across and within gender in a large, national probability sample in New Zealand (N = 14,230). There was support for the gender inversion hypothesis on some traits; lesbians (relative to heterosexual women) had similar conscientiousness scores to those of heterosexual men, and gay men (relative to heterosexual men) scored similar to heterosexual women in agreeableness and emotional stability. Our work highlights the importance of taking an intersectional approach to simultaneously consider gender and sexual identity when it comes to understanding personality.

We add to this knowledge base by examining how attitudes to fatherhood change across the transition to parenthood. This is important within a historical period in which definitions of what it means to be a good father are changing to emphasise hands-on involvement in childcare, yet there has been little institutional change to support this. Our empirical analyses rely on long-running, panel data from Britain and Australia, and fixed-effect panel regression models. We find that attitudes to fatherhood change significantly after the birth of a first child. For most of the measures considered, parenthood results in men's attitudes to fatherhood becoming comparatively more egalitarian than women's. While both Australian and British men become more enthusiastic towards being involved in the care and upbringing of their children after experiencing parenthood, Australian women become less likely to agree that fathers should do so. These findings provide a partial explanation for why couples engage in more traditional gender divisions of labour after parenthood. They suggest that men's involvement in childcare is not only constrained at the institutional and employment levels, but also by their female partners becoming more reluctant to support an active fathering role. More broadly, our research adds to growing evidence demonstrating that first births are an important life-course marker, and parenthood has the capacity to shift how men and women perceive their familial roles and their broader roles in society.

We aim to analyze this fear in relation to a parent's gender, family gender composition (having sons only, daughters only or a mixed composition with both sons and daughters), and feared type of crime, with a sample of 290 parents from the Basque Country (north of Spain). A mixed-design ANCOVA showed no differences between mothers' and fathers' fears, but a statistically significant interaction was found between family gender composition and crime type. Parents in families with at least one daughter (daughters only and mixed families) reported more frequent fear than those in families with only sons, and fear was even more frequent when considering sexual abuse. Increased fear for daughters happens for all the considered crime types, even for those in which victims are usually boys. Findings highlight the relevance of parental fears even in objectively safe cities like the studied one, and they have implications for future studies on gendered transmission of fears and on related parental practices with impact on the autonomy and well-being of children.

It is important to investigate the reasons behind individuals' support for girl child marriages. The aim of the present study is to examine attitudes toward girl child marriages in Turkey within the perspective of social dominance theory (Sidanius and Pratto 1999). Namely, we investigate the relationship between social dominance orientation and attitudes toward girl child marriages. We also examine the mediating role of ambivalent sexism (both hostile and benevolent) in this association. Students (N = 388) from two universities in Ankara completed the Ambivalent Sexism Inventory, the Social Dominance Orientation (SDO) Scale, and our Attitudes toward Girl Child Marriages Scale. Results indicate that men have more positive attitudes toward girl child marriages than women do. In addition, SDO predicts positive attitudes toward girl child marriages. Also, hostile, but not benevolent, sexism mediates the relationship between SDO and attitudes toward girl child marriages. The present study shows that those who endorse male dominance and gender inequality also have more positive attitudes toward girl child marriages. It also shows that these people draw on their hostile attitudes toward women in order to legitimize these kinds of marriages.

No Rest for the Stigmatized: A Model of Organizational Health and Workplace Sexism (OHWS)	SEX ROLES			English	Article						Presenteeism; Sexism; Health; Job security; Job autonomy	SICKNESS PRESENTEEISM; JOB DEMANDS; WORK; ABSENCE; DISCRIMINATION; ABSENTEEISM; STRESS; ATTENDANCE; CONSEQUENCES; FLEXIBILITY	Employee sick attendance at work-presenteeism-poses a significant threat to both employee health and organizational productivity. However, despite the wealth of literature examining organizational predictors of presenteeism, little research has investigated the impact of stigmatized status on employee work attendance when sick. We argue that gender discrimination in the workplace promotes negative job perceptions and poorer health, ultimately contributing to increased rates of presenteeism among female employees. In two studies assessing U.S. women's perceptions of workplace sexism, job security, job autonomy, job stress, reported health, and workplace sick-related attendance, we develop the framework for the Organizational Health and Workplace Sexism (OHWS) model. Study 1 utilized a large nationally representative dataset to conduct a secondary data analysis that preliminarily investigated the unique impact of perceived workplace discrimination. Results found that women who experienced workplace sexism reported more negative job perceptions and poorer health outcomes, yet they did not stay home from work more often than non-stigmatized women did-suggesting sick work attendance. Study 2 surveyed employed women through a paid online survey service in a more detailed assessment of the variables. Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) revealed that workplace sexism negatively related to reported health, job security, and job autonomy, which were positively associated with perceived job stress. Job factors also were negatively related to health, which directly correlated with rates of presenteeism.

Results indicated the majority of the mother-child dyads report similar risk using eight individual items (60.9%-77.1%) and on the composite measures (61.9% and 54.2%). However, concordance was lower than anticipated. Findings highlight the importance of not simply relying on parental report but instead obtaining the child's report about their own exposure to intimate partner violence (IPV) in clinical, research, and forensic applications.

Empirical studies are warranted to examine the unique experiences and resource needs of Deaf women, along with barriers excluding Deaf participants from IPV research and service provision. Our study addresses these gaps by providing a profile of 80 Deaf women attending an IPV program serving individuals with disabilities. Demographic and psychosocial characteristics, referral channels that led women to the program, and services sought post-referral are discussed to help guide best practices with Deaf survivors of IPV.

This study interviewed 2,437 Norwegian women (response rate = 45.0%) about their experiences with violence. Logistic regression analyses were employed to estimate associations of multiple categories of childhood violence with adult victimization. Women exposed to CSA often experienced other childhood violence, and the total burden of violence was associated with adult rape and intimate partner violence (IPV). Researchers and clinicians need to take into account the full spectrum of violence exposure.

Pregnancy-associated deaths due to homicide, suicide, or accidental overdose were compared with natural deaths. Violent deaths accounted for almost 30% of the cases. Homicides accounted for 13% of all the deaths in the sample, larger than any single natural cause of death. Homicide was the leading manner of death for Black women and was 4.5 times the rate of White decedents. Recommendations include expanding maternal death surveillance, committing to ending violence against women, and promoting universal screenings for domestic or interpersonal violence.

Community women (N = 197) with divorce histories reported on lifetime intimate partner abuse, including sheltering for safety. Prevalence of informal sheltering (43%) exceeded that of formal sheltering (11%). Rates/levels of coercive control, severe violence, injury, and police involvement were comparable for women who sheltered formally or informally, and exceeded those of women who never sheltered. Sheltering histories can be identified in community samples of women with divorce histories. Informal sheltering is prevalent, and comparable to formal sheltering in terms of correlations with abuse severity.

This study of 350 Canadian abused women represents the first quantitative examination of such protective strategies. The actions that mothers most commonly used and perceived as effective include showing affection and being nurturing to their children. The strategies often suggested by professionals, such as contacting police and obtaining protection orders, were used less and considered less effective than informal strategies. Professionals are urged to ask mothers what strategies they use, especially those who do not involve formal systems.

The author analyzes data from 15 battered female marriage migrants who share the same ethnicity as their husbands to illustrate how the immigration of female marriage migrants intricately intersects with gender, class, and culture to form a multifaceted system that traps battered marriage migrants in abusive marriages. It is proposed that marriage migration, as a distinct form of migration, involves certain intrinsic risk factors that make marriage migrants particularly vulnerable to IPV.

Their allegations of violence put them at odds with a system that values mediated settlements and shared parenting. Skeptical responses, accusations of parental alienation, and pressure to agree to unsafe arrangements exacerbated the effects of post-separation violence. Core themes in the women's narratives of engagement with the family law system-silencing, control, and undermining the mother-child relationship-mirrored domestic violence dynamics, suggesting the concept of secondary victimization as a useful lens for understanding their experiences.

Findings indicated that controlling behavior, childhood exposure to violence, and husband's use of alcohol were predictors of physical and sexual abuse. Respondent's use of violence increased risk of physical abuse. Implications for programming in Mali are discussed.

The rigorous development and testing of prevention and intervention strategies on a large scale are hampered by many of these methodological difficulties as well as ethical considerations that make conducting IPV research difficult. The author presents a review of the current state of IPV research in these three areas (ethics, methods, and measurement) with suggestions for innovative research possibilities building from this status quo.

This study explored women's responses to these unwanted experiences through online surveys completed by 153 female bargoers (aged 1929) randomly recruited from a bar district. More than 75% had experienced sexual touching or persistence (46% both). Most women used multiple deterrent strategies, including evasion, facial expressions, direct refusals, aggression, friends' help, and leaving the premises. Women experienced negative feelings (disrespected, violated, disgusted, angry, embarrassed), especially from incidents involving touching. Cultural change is needed to reduce substantial negative impacts of sexual harassment on women in drinking and other settings.

The sample included 589 adolescents from a rural, southern county who participated in a longitudinal study of teen dating violence victimization and perpetration. Results suggest that informal help-seeking intentions are an important link between perceived social support and professional helpseeking intentions. Findings highlight the importance of informal help-seeking and informal help-giving in fostering professional help-seeking for adolescent victims and perpetrators of dating violence.

Results indicated that predictors varied across types of revictimization: Unwanted contact and coercion appeared more common in social contexts more hostile toward survivors, whereas forcible assaults and SIAs occurred in circumstances where survivors were vulnerable to being targeted by perpetrators. Overall, the strongest predictors were social environments hostile to survivors, race, childhood sexual abuse, decreased refusal assertiveness, and having more sexual partners.

This information is fundamental to improving Criminal Legal System (CLS) and community-partner understanding of and response to intimate partner violence (IPV). The authors meet this need by analyzing 208 women's descriptions of their arrests and subsequent court order to intervention programs for using force. From these, the authors frame nine categorical descriptions of women's actions. The descriptions and categories highlight areas for CLS and community-partners' growing understanding of this complex issue.

Current explanations for women's higher involvement in highbrow cultural activities primarily focus on adults; overemphasize class-, work- and cultural capital-related explanations; and do not uncover the identity-related and interactional mechanisms behind the gendering of taste during socialization. In the present paper we use gender identity theory and a "doing gender" perspective to understand cultural taste differences between male and female adolescents. Using multilevel analyses on a random sample of 5227 Flemish 7th graders (M (age) = 12.18) who completed a survey in their classrooms, we find that higher gender typicality (i.e., identification as a typical male or female) and higher pressure to conform to gender stereotypes are associated with slightly higher interests in arts-, theatre-, and literature-related activities for young women, but with much lower highbrow interests for young men. This difference indicates that identity-related processes and interactional conformity pressures are important mechanisms reinforcing the gendering of cultural tastes. Implications for research on gender, class, and cultural capital, as well as potential ways to make schools safe environments for the expression of gender non-stereotypical cultural tastes, are discussed.

The study reveals that women's total workload was much higher than that of men. The pattern of work and time use have hardly changed. The burden of domestic work and care basically falls on women of the household. The participation of men in these activities is nominal. Women's contribution to farm activities is significant, and further, they do most of the work in animal husbandry. Consequently, they have much less time for leisure and sleep. Our study highlights the permanence of traditional intra-household gender disparities in the distribution of work within the household. These values are transferred to the next generation as young girls are expected to help their mothers in carrying out domestic duties and care work, while boys have no such obligation.

The current study examines climate-induced vulnerabilities to which men and women are exposed and explores the factors that affect women more than men. This study was conducted in purposively selected Kurigram district as a representative of Northern Bangladesh, where people experience climatic divergence and extreme poverty. Data were collected from 100 randomly selected participants from three villages of Kurigram district through questionnaire survey and focus group discussions. The gender vulnerability index was used to measure the extent of vulnerability and the factors influencing vulnerability. The results show that 72.2 per cent are highly vulnerable with females being almost more than twice as vulnerable as males. The analysis indicates that the amount of land, difficulty in bathing when the basic bathroom structure was destroyed and use of borrowed money were the main determinants of gender vulnerability in changing climatic conditions. The findings of this study might help to integrate gender into climate change policy discourse and find appropriate adaptation strategies in Bangladesh, particularly in Northwestern Bangladesh.

The Two Lives of Leela Dube Introductory Remarks on her Life and Work	INDIAN JOURNAL OF GENDER STUDIES			English	Article						Tradition; modernity; patriarchy; matriarchy; gender studies		This essay presents an integrated account of the personal and professional lives of Leela Dube. Born and brought up in a traditional, Maharashtrian, Brahman household, which was urban and in some respects modern too, Leela Dube journeyed from such a home through modern school and college education into a marriage by personal choice and a professional career in anthropology. It is an account of the engagement of an intelligent and highly educated person with two distinct in some respect discrepant worlds without completely separating them. Happy to be a home-maker with a family, she also carved out a place of distinction for herself as a scholar of kinship studies and the anthropology of women. Indeed, she came to be hailed as a pioneer in the field of gender studies in India. One of the implications of the interpretation offered here is that the enclosing of complex lives in easy-to-grasp theoretical pigeon holes may well fail to capture in their fullness the struggles and achievements of an extraordinary multi-dimensional person.

This essay traces the zig-zag process of her intellectual evolution over five decades into one of the leading feminist anthropologists of her day - in India, in the Asian region, and indeed globally. Crucial turning points in this evolution were: (i) her self-initiated field study of the accommodation of the matrilineal kinship system of the Lakshadweep islanders with the androcentric legal apparatus of Islam; (ii) her role as the sociologist' member of the famous Committee on the Status of Women in India, an experience that convinced her that the best contribution she could make to the emerging women's studies discourse was through the conceptual and methodological resources of her own discipline, anthropology; and (iii) her self-conscious deployment of the so-called comparative method' of anthropology to explore the contrasting patterns of gender relations in strongly patrilineal' South Asia versus bilateral' Southeast Asia. She saw this ambitious comparative exercise, largely ignored by both her admirers and her critics, as enabling an emancipatory rethinking of some of the dominant paradigms of Western feminism. It was also, incidentally, a bold step in the disciplinary evolution of Indian social anthropology.

Her discussion about the disjuncture between codified Islamic law and practice in relation to marriage and property devolution, her elaboration on the way law was manipulated strategically, and the image of flexibility in kinship practices are all important for a contemporary understanding of matriliny and kinship in general. Similarly, her discussion of what matriliny meant for women and more broadly the intersections of gender and kinship remain important concerns in the study of kinship. Furthermore, I point to the shifts in her work as she engaged with feminist politics and scholarship.

As the gender order has shifted to incorporate girls' and women's movement into the masculine realm of sports, coverage of women's sports has shifted away from overtly denigrating coverage in 1989 to ostensibly respectful but lackluster coverage in 2014. To theorize this shift, we introduce the concept of gender-bland sexism, a contemporary gender framework that superficially extends the principles of merit to women in sports. Televised news and highlight shows frame women in uninspired ways, making women's athletic accomplishments appear lackluster compared to those of men's. Because this bland language normalizes a hierarchy between men's and women's sports while simultaneously avoiding charges of overt sexism, this article contributes to gender theory by illuminating how women can be marginalized in male-dominated, male-controlled settings via individualized merit-based assessments of talent.

J	Lamont, E				Lamont, Ellen			"We Can Write the Scripts Ourselves": Queer Challenges to Heteronormative Courtship Practices	GENDER & SOCIETY			English	Article						gender; sexuality; dating; courtship; LGBTQ	TRANSGENDER FAMILIES; GENDER; LABOR; DIVISION; WORK; GAY; SEX	Courtship conventions are premised on widespread and deeply held cultural beliefs that men and women need and want different things from their romantic relationships. Yet queer relationships challenge the notion of distinct gendered behaviors in romantic relationships, and queer people often explicitly seek to undermine conventional relationship practices. Using interview data from 40 LGBTQ-identified respondents, I examine how queer people negotiate culturally dominant gendered dating and courtship practices. My findings show that, rather than replicate heterosexual norms, respondents actively reject them, seeking new and more egalitarian ways of building romantic relationships. Significantly, the narratives drawn on to justify egalitarian dating practices are similar to those used in their committed relationships. Respondents emphasized egalitarian, flexible, and non-gendered care work in committed relationships, indicating that how people date may potentially set the stage for the dynamics in their relationships. The importance placed on these alternative norms in queer communities, however, contradicts respondents' assertions that they can create relationships free from cultural constraints, demonstrating how emerging norms can breed their own pressures for conformity.

J	Avishai, O; Irby, CA				Avishai, Orit; Irby, Courtney Ann			Bifurcated Conversations in Sociological Studies of Religion and Gender	GENDER & SOCIETY			English	Article						missing feminist revolution; religion; sociology of knowledge; feminism; sociology of gender	MISSING FEMINIST REVOLUTION; KNOWLEDGE; HISTORY; FAMILY; WOMEN	Feminist sociologists claim that while feminist insights have been incorporated in sociological paradigms and women sociologists have been well-integrated into academia, sociological frameworks have not been transformed, a process known as the missing feminist revolution. Yet, few have examined how the missing feminist revolution operates in specific subdisciplines and the mechanisms that sustain it. This article undertakes these tasks by analyzing religion and gender scholarship published in six sociology journals over the past 32 years. We find evidence of partial integration and continued marginalization. However, we also document disparate networks of interlocutors that operate in two distinct intellectual fieldsreligion and gender. We argue that this bifurcation partially explains the missing feminist revolution and that insularity of feminist conversations likely contributes to this process. Our findings shed light on obstacles to transforming mainstream disciplines.

J	Henriksen, AK				Henriksen, Ann-Karina			Confined to Care: Girls' Gendered Vulnerabilities in Secure Institutions	GENDER & SOCIETY			English	Article						girls; marginalization; penal-welfare responses; pathology; governance	YOUNG-WOMEN; PUNISHMENT; WELFARE	In Denmark, secure care institutions are gender-integrated and accommodate young people with a wide range of psychiatric and social troubles. The large majority of young people are placed here in surrogate custody, and a minority, mostly girls, are placed here in protective care. Based on a qualitative study of gendered practices and experiences in Danish secure care institutions, this article provides insight into how gender and pathology merge to produce vulnerabilities in care. The study finds that while girls are viewed through a lens of pathology, secure care practices largely fail to provide treatment for girls. Drawing on feminist scholarship on penal-welfare responses to women, I argue that institutional practices contribute to the production of disordered selves and the marginalization of girls in secure care. This demonstrates how welfare provision for the most marginalized girls reproduces and reinforces the inequalities that brought them into secure care. The study hereby supplements an emerging scholarship on how gender underpins penal-welfare responses and interventions.

Gender Stereotypes and the Coordination of Mnemonic Work within Heterosexual Couples: Romantic Partners Manage their Daily To-Dos	SEX ROLES			English	Article						Sharing mental labor; Gender stereotypes; Outstanding tasks; Helping behavior; Prospective memory	DIVISION-OF-LABOR; TRANSACTIVE MEMORY-SYSTEMS; HOUSEHOLD LABOR; RETROSPECTIVE MEMORY; CLOSE RELATIONSHIPS; DEFAULT NETWORK; EVERYDAY MEMORY; AGE-DIFFERENCES; UNITED-STATES; AGENTIC WOMEN	Couples appear to help each other remember outstanding tasks ("to-dos") by issuing reminders. We examine if women and men differ in the frequency with which they offer this form of mnemonic assistance. Five studies measure how heterosexual couples coordinate mnemonic work in romantic relationships. The first two studies demonstrate that men are assumed to do less of this form of mnemonic work (Study 1) and experience less societal pressure to do so than women do (Study 2). The next three studies suggest that men tend to do less of this mnemonic work than women do and that, when men do mnemonically help their partners, the help tends to involve errands for which they are stakeholders. This notion was evidenced in the greater accessibility of examples of women's reminding acts than men's reminding acts for both partners (Study 3) and in the less helpful reminders that men provided, compared to those women provided, as rated by both partners (Study 4a) and independent coders (Study 4b). These results converge on the possibility that men, relative to women, are less inclined to be concerned with keeping track of their partners" outstanding needs, perhaps because doing so is a behavior that is less strongly prescribed for men than for women. Implications for helping behavior and the possible consequences associated with performing disproportionate mnemonic work in relationships are discussed.

Themes revealed divergent experiences for African American and Mexican American young women. In particular, African American participants reported egalitarian familial gender ideologies and sexual objectification of Black women, as well as more open and positive attitudes toward dating and sexuality. In contrast, Mexican American participants reported patriarchal familial gender ideologies and the portrayed mistreatment of Latinas in telenovelas and Spanish language songs, along with cautious attitudes towards dating and sexuality. Additionally, Mexican American participants reported that they censored their communication about sexual matters with their family. Overall, findings suggest that interventions should be tailored accordingly for African American and Mexican American youth. Interventions with African American young women should focus on providing accurate information on safer sexual practices, whereas interventions with Mexican American young women should focus on promoting constructive conceptualizations of gender roles, which could help foster self-efficacy around sexual communication with parents and potential partners.

Despite cyber bullying typically occurring outside the school environment, the impact of being involved in cyber bullying is likely to spill over to school. Fully 285 11- to 15-year-olds (125 male and 160 female, M (age) = 12.19 years, SD = 1.03) completed measures of cyber bullying involvement, self-esteem, trust, perceived peer acceptance, and perceptions of the value of learning and the importance of school. For young women, involvement in cyber bullying as a victim, bully, or bully/victim negatively predicted perceptions of learning and school, and perceived peer acceptance mediated this relationship. The results indicated that involvement in cyber bullying negatively predicted perceived peer acceptance which, in turn, positively predicted perceptions of learning and school. For young men, fulfilling the bully/victim role negatively predicted perceptions of learning and school. Consequently, for young women in particular, involvement in cyber bullying spills over to impact perceptions of learning. The findings of the current study highlight how stressors external to the school environment can adversely impact young women's perceptions of school and also have implications for the development of interventions designed to ameliorate the effects of cyber bullying.

The paper offers an intersectional perspective taking into account interconnected and overlapping factors (gender, ethnicity, religion, and family status) that affect not only the issues and challenges these women face in the labour market but also the individual agency and strategies they use to overcome any obstacles in the way of their employment and career. The results show that although Muslim women continue to face a myriad of challenges in the workplace, they are also able to tackle some of these issues through their individual strategies and networks, such as personal networks and further education. The study highlights the need for policymakers and employers to consider intersectionality to enable ethnic minority women's inclusion and leadership within and outside the workplace.

We present data that considers these relationships at the cross-national level of analysis, using country-level measures of gender equality (the Gender Global Gap Index), aggregate measures of attitudes toward lesbians and gay men in a country, and a newly constructed measure of the progressiveness of sexual orientation laws. We show for the first time to our knowledge that countries that have the greatest gender equality also have (a) the most positive aggregate attitudes toward lesbians and gay men and (b) the strongest legislative protections for lesbians and gay men. These results hold even when controlling for plausible third variables such as a country's level of religiosity and its economic and political development, each with their own separate effects. We discuss the results within the context of the various forces that contribute to, and work against, ensuring more accepting attitudes of, and equal rights for, lesbians and gay men. In conclusion, to fully understand support for lesbians and gay men and the laws that protect them, one should also consider how women are treated in a country.	[Henry, P.

In-depth semi-structured interviews were conducted with eight Black and Latina 16-19 year-old young women who identified as lesbian or bisexual. Using the Listening Guide method of narrative analysis, two voices pertaining to young women's objectification experiences were identified: a Voice of Surveillance and a Voice of Self-Surveillance. Findings suggest that young women experienced sexual objectification as rooted in their gender, sexuality, and racial identities. Experiences were further shaped by the contexts in which objectification occurred: participants voiced distinct struggles navigating (a) sexual harassment and violence in relationships with peers and romantic partners, (b) sexual harassment and discipline in school, and (c) street harassment and violence from men. Findings highlight the importance of understanding sexual objectification experiences as they are informed by gender, sexuality, and race, as well as the ways that young women actively cope with and resist objectification. Psychologists, activists, and mental health professionals are encouraged to consider how sexual objectification is rooted in multiple forms of oppression, its implications for young women's identity, desire, and well-being, and how young women can be supported as they struggle against it.

In contemporary times, however, adult novelty parties, or gatherings where women can learn about and purchase sex toys or other sensual aids in a group setting, are widespread. The current pervasiveness of novelty parties may be indicative of greater acceptance of women's sexuality in contemporary Western society. The goal of the present study is to determine whether young people are more accepting of women's sexuality and desire via their evaluations of women who attend novelty parties relative to more traditional kitchen product parties. In two experiments, U.S. college students read either a novelty party catalog or a kitchen party catalog, and they evaluated hypothetical female attendees of their respective party catalog type across ten total domains. In Experiment 1 (n = 205), novelty party attendees were rated as more vivacious, less traditional, and more insecure than were kitchen party attendees. In Experiment 2 (n = 211), women were harsher than men on novelty party attendees compared to kitchen party attendees in most domains, and men rated novelty party attendees as more masculine than kitchen party attendees, whereas women rated novelty party attendees as less masculine and feminine than kitchen party attendees. Applied and social implications of the present results are discussed, highlighting ways to improve perceptions of women's sexual desires and pleasure.

This Protocol states among other things the right of women to medical abortion under certain circumstances in a context where most of sub-Saharan African countries have restrictive abortion laws.

As such, the controversy stemmed from this resistance shows what is at stake in the liberalization of abortion. In the post-colonial African context, these issues are presented as a Western invasion and lead to specific type of resistant position.

J	Labussiere, M				Labussiere, Marie			"Our femininity as a weapon". Ethnography of the Antigones, a far-right women's movement in contemporary France	GENRE SEXUALITE & SOCIETE			French	Article						feminism; antifeminism; extreme right; Catholicism; Manif pour tous		This article studies the Antigones, a women's movement created in 2013 in the wake of the French mobilizations against same-sex marriage. Affiliated to right and extreme right-wing movements - and especially to nativist, traditionalist Catholic or nationalistic fringes - the Antigones have been categorized as anti-feminist, owing to their promotion of the heterosexual family and of a differentialist conception of gender. An ethnography of the Antigones three years after the group's foundation gives the opportunity to highlight other less visible features of the activists' commitments and discourses. Militants seek to lay the ground for a feminism that enables them to articulate conflicting aspirations: on the one hand a commitment to women's emancipation, and on the other hand their attachment to political, religious and moral values, resulting from their socialization through familial, educational and political experiences. As a result, they advocate tackling issues related to sexuality in the light of an anti-capitalist, differentialist and spiritual definition of women that keeps theological or doctrinal arguments at bay.

J	Michels, D				Michels, David			Making their Couples a Cause. Arrangements, Desire and Coupledom in Women's recourse to sexology	GENRE SEXUALITE & SOCIETE			French	Article						France; conjugality; sexuality; gender; sexological consultation		Drawing on interviews with fourteen women patients experiencing sexual difficulties and having consulted a sexologist, this article analyzes the role of coupledom in their experience. Specifically, the data reveal that relationship issues are the underlying causes for their sexology consultations and that they interrupt their sexuality through the lens of coupledom, as do to many of their peers. However, analyzing their explanations for their decisions to see a sexologist, the article shows that these women mobilize two registers drawing on two distinct perspectives about sexuality to justify themselves. First, they usually use a register of "necessity." They resort to sexology in direct response to the perceived threat that their relationship will end because of a lack of sex, which either goes against an egalitarian ideal they have of sexuality in a relationship, or because they think it may lead to infidelity. Then, usually later in the interview, they use a register of "intention." They talk of their choice as a project in their relationships, which is part of a larger strategy of constructing and managing their couples.

Embracing Our Values: Ending the "Birth Wars'' and Improving Women's Satisfaction with Childbirth	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF FEMINIST APPROACHES TO BIOETHICS			English	Article						childbirth; value-affirming childbirth; deep intentionality; values and technology		Anne Drapkin Lyerly argues that U.S. women's experience of childbirth is a negative one because of confusion about what constitutes a "good birth.'' She is partially right. In addition, these negative childbirth experiences result from women feeling that they have betrayed themselves in how they gave birth. I argue that this stems from confused thinking that one must use or eschew technology in childbirth to be "true to oneself '' and that addressing this problem requires recognizing the multiple values simultaneously embedded in birth technologies. Doing so demonstrates that women can give birth in a variety of ways while remaining true to their values.

However, opponents of fracking argue that it is linked to health problems because it releases specific toxins that contaminate the air and ground water. In this essay, I offer a focused analysis of twenty qualitative interviews with women who live in Pennsylvania near fracking sites. The findings indicate that exposure to fracking has negative impacts on women's health by increasing their exposure to contaminated water and provokes gendered attacks on activism.

Unfortunately, the success of harm reduction strategies such as medicalization has been met with stiff opposition in favor of a rights-based framework of FGC eradication. In this paper, I join with others who have advocated for medicalization as beneficence. I question the Western paternalistic FGC eradication strategy and support the autonomy and empowerment of non-Western women in FGC-practicing communities.									59	0	0	4	4	UNIV TORONTO PRESS INC	TORONTO	JOURNALS DIVISION, 5201 DUFFERIN ST, DOWNSVIEW, TORONTO, ON M3H 5T8, CANADA	1937-4585	1937-4577		INT J FEM APPROACHES	Int.

J	Teo, TW; Yeo, LW				Teo, Tang Wee; Yeo, Leck Wee			Gender Studies of Science and Science Education in Singapore	ASIAN WOMEN			English	Article						gender; science; science education; Singapore	SCHOOL SCIENCE; RASCH ANALYSIS; STUDENTS; TEACHERS; ACHIEVEMENT; BIOLOGY; PROGRAM; PHYSICS; GIRLS	Singapore, in recent years, has seen increased efforts by individuals, social organizations, institutions, and private companies advocating for more women in science. However, as compared to many other places, such as the U.S. and Europe, gender studies of science and science education in Singapore are limited. Further, such studies are underrepresented in the local science and science education literature. In this paper, we review gender studies of science and science education in Singapore to show the status of this literature. We analyze the papers for the following: a) studies that examine gender as the main or auxiliary construct, b) the period of publication, c) topics in gender studies, d) the philosophical approach of the studies, e) research methods, and f) the type of participants. Our analysis of 39 empirical journal papers show the highest number of publications during the period 2011-2015. Gender is examined as an auxiliary construct in most papers. Most of the studies embody postpositivist worldviews, where the use of quantitative research methods to compare cognitive and affective differences between the two genders are common. The most frequently targeted group of research participants are students aged 13-16 (Grades 7-10). Based on this review, we suggest future research agendas for researchers, local and international, who may be interested to push for more studies in this field through local and/or international studies.

It analyzes the statistical effects of the respondents' confirmation, perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, and satisfaction on their intentions to continue use. Purposive sampling was employed to collect questionnaire survey data on women who had used a DMV primarily for a breast health check-up. Of 535 distributed questionnaires, 517 valid cases were analyzed for a response rate of 96.64%. Confirmation, perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, and satisfaction all positively correlated with intent to continue using the DMV. The results of a multiple regression analysis reveal that the combined effects of confirmation, perceived usefulness, and satisfaction explained about 86% of the variation in the respondents' intent to continue using the DMV. These results serve as a vital reference for improving the quality of breast cancer prevention services and strategies in Taiwan and form a basis for related research, development, and programs.

The Actor-Network Theory (ANI) is adopted as the analytical approach. Two upper-secondary schools, IL Senior High School and MM Vocational High School, were selected due to their emphasis on science and technology education. Student surveys were conducted to investigate how students chose between courses and majors; two chemistry lab classes, one led by a male teacher and the other by a female teacher, in LL Senior High School, and one chemical-engineering lab class of MM Vocational High School were observed multiple times. Lab class teachers from both schools were interviewed. The survey data showed clear gender segregation in both schools, but only part of the students considered gender to be an important factor influencing their selection of courses and major fields. Observations of the relatively gender-balanced chemistry laboratories revealed that equipment and instrumentation were sufficient and equally accessible to all, that girls and boys behaved differently in the lab, and that patterns of teacher-student interaction varied by teacher's gender, which might result in differences in laboratory learning between boys and girls. The concept of embodied pedagogical insight of female teachers, which may specifically benefit girls' learning, is discussed.

J	Ogawa, M				Ogawa, Mariko			History of Women's Participation in STEM Fields in Japan	ASIAN WOMEN			English	Article						women in STEM fields in Japan; women in engineering; women's higher education in STEM		This paper surveys female holders of bachelor's and doctoral degrees of STEM (science, technology, engineering, mathematics, and sometimes including medicine) from the modern period of the Meiji era to present day Japan. It discusses early women's education in Japan, female doctorate holders in STEM, and statistical analysis about Japanese higher education. Female university students appeared for the first time in 1913. Tohoku Imperial University matriculated three women, all of whom majored in science. The first woman who gained a doctoral degree in science appeared in 1927. A few years later, women earned various doctoral degrees, such as medicine, agriculture, and pharmacology. However, it was not until 1959 that the first female doctorate in engineering appeared. Female scientists started to appear around 1930, but a certain number of female engineers did not appear until around 1960. This year may be regarded as the beginning of the history of female researchers in all STEM to have been systematically educated in Japan. I also discuss the statistical analysis from the 1960s up until today. Almost over a half century has passed since then; however, the proportion of female students in STEM has been small. The Japanese Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology (MEXT) has been making efforts since 2006 to improve their numbers. However, these efforts have not been adequate. Lastly, considering what prevents women STEM researchers from becoming more active despite MEXT's efforts, I identify the inadequacies in the collection and historical analysis of Japanese sex-disaggjegated statistical data.

J	Kim, H; Lee, CS				Kim, Hwalbin; Lee, Claire Shinhea			Collective Memory of Japanese Military 'Comfort Women' and South Korean Media: The Case of Television Dramas, Eyes of Dawn (1991) and Snowy Road (2015)	ASIAN WOMEN			English	Article						collective memory; television drama; comfort women; South Korea; Japanese colonial era	WAR	A nation's memory is a reconstruction of the past. Accordingly, this study explores how South Korean television (TV) dramas Eyes of Dawn (1991) and Snony Road (2015) helped shape the collective memory of Japanese colonial rule. Both dramas highlighted the experiences of comfort women, Korean women forced to provide sex to Japanese soldiers. This study analyzes the representations, technical factors, and newspaper discourse of the dramas to examine how they influenced collective memories of comfort women. By comparing and contrasting the dramas, this study reveals that while both generated public awareness and controversy, Eyes of Dawn and Snony Road represented differently oriented colonial memories of comfort women: A patriotic-oriented memory and a humanism-focused memory, respectively. Specifically, in illuminating colonial rule, Eyes of Dawn showed a traditional good and evil dichotomy, while Snowy Road revealed a more complex and diverse context Given the socio-political contexts of 1991 and 2015, this study suggests that Eyes of Dawn functioned to inform the public about the comfort women, whereas Snony Road aimed to reflect upon the impact of comfort women in South Korean society. Thus, while acknowledging that collective memory is a construct that can change over time, we contend that the media's role (especially TV drama) is critical in this process. More generally, this study contributes to the study of memory, journalism, history, and poplar communication.

J	Kim, J; Okazaki, S				Kim, Jeehun; Okazaki, Sumie			Short-Term 'Intensive Mothering' on a Budget: Working Mothers of Korean Children Studying Abroad in Southeast Asia	ASIAN WOMEN			English	Article						Korean; education; study abroad; working mothers; Southeast Asia	WILD GEESE FATHERS; TRANSNATIONAL FAMILIES; EDUCATION; LANGUAGE; SINGAPORE; TRANSFORMATION; STUDENTS; GENDER; WOMEN	Although pre-college or early study abroad (ESA) in the West used to be characterized primarily as a cosmopolitan aspirational strategy of affluent East Asian families with professional fathers and stay-at-home mothers (Cho, 2004), less-affluent middle-class Korean families have also begun to pursue FSA in the past decade. This study examined the parenting narratives of working mothers from less-affluent middle-class Korean families whose children engaged in ESA in Southeast Asia. We found that working mothers viewed affordable ESA as an opportunity both to facilitate their children's English language learning and to engage in short-term intensive mothetiq (Hays, 1996), and thereby to realize their own desires to conform to the prevailing ideology of an ideal Korean mother as an education manager (Park & Abelmann, 2004). Their narratives, however, also revealed unequal access to cultural knowledge with regard to navigating institutions related to ESA, and this inequality appeared to reproduce the families' class disadvantages. These findings imply that global education must be inclusive of working Korean (and other Asian) mothers as well as those from less-affluent and less privileged backgrounds. With respect to policy, these findings convey the need for greater access to a high-quality English language education, and a re-examination of the expectation that acquiring fluency in the English language serves as a gatekeeper to cosmopolitan upward mobility.

J	Duford, R				Duford, Rochelle			Daughters of the Enlightenment: Reconstructing Adorno on Gender and Feminist Praxis	HYPATIA-A JOURNAL OF FEMINIST PHILOSOPHY			English	Article								This article offers a reconstruction of Theodor Adorno's work as it concerns sex/gender and feminist praxis. Although the prevailing interpretation of Adorno's work conceptualizes its relationship to women as one of either exclusion or essentialism, I argue that both the reading of Sade's Juliette in Dialectic of Enlightenment, as well as a number of Adorno's aphorisms in Minima Moralia, present complex feminist claims and commitments. Max Horkheimer and Adorno position Juliette as a subject of the Enlightenment, forestalling the possibility that women qua women are potentially utopian figures. I utilize Adorno's work in Minima Moralia to show that hefar from excluding or essentializing womenwas interested in metaphorically capturing the subjective conditions developed by a system of binary sex/gender within a heteropatriarchal society. Indeed, one can find an iteration of queer theoretical commitments in Minima Moralia. As a result, I argue that he displays a number of straightforwardly feminist commitments: that a liberated society requires the disambiguation of sex from gender, affirming the nonnaturalness of our social sex/gender regime, and claiming that all subjects as gendered subjects are damaged by living within a heteropatriarchal society. Lastly, I provide preliminary evidence of Adorno's critique of (neo)liberal feminist praxis.

J	Greenswag, K				Greenswag, Kari			The Problem with "Caring" Human Rights	HYPATIA-A JOURNAL OF FEMINIST PHILOSOPHY			English	Article							CARE ETHICS	Although Daniel Engster's caring human rights are, on the surface, a compelling way to bring the concept of care into the international political realm, I argue they actually serve to perpetuate some of the same problems of mainstream human-rights discourses. The problem is twofold. First, Engster's particular care theory relies on an uncritical acceptance of our dependence relations. It can, therefore, not only overlook how local and global institutions, norms, and the marketplace shape our relations of (inter)dependence, but also serve to further naturalize our current dependence relations. Second, Engster's caring human rights are only minimally feminist, which means that they do not pay attention to the way in which women's full and equal political participation is a necessary component to challenging and overcoming the oppression, marginalization, and exploitation of women and their caring labor worldwide. Although I am sympathetic to Engster's goals and some of his proposed policy solutions, I argue that we should not abandon the critical, feminist lens of care ethics in favor of caring human rights that cannot overcome the care critique of mainstream human-rights discourses.			kari.greenswag@gmail.com						23	0	0	0	0	WILEY	HOBOKEN	111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA	0887-5367	1527-2001		HYPATIA	Hypatia	FAL	2017	32	4					801	816		10.1111/hypa.12362				16	Philosophy; Women's Studies	Philosophy; Women's Studies	FL6OO	WOS:000414365300004					2018-09-20	
J	Hillsburg, HA				Hillsburg, Heather A.			Subjectification and Confession in Contemporary Memoirs of Abduction and Prolonged Captivity	HYPATIA-A JOURNAL OF FEMINIST PHILOSOPHY			English	Article								A striking trend is emerging in the Canadian and American literary landscape, and memoirs with the following narrative trajectory are now widely read: a stranger abducts a young woman, and holds her captive for years. She endures sexual, physical, and emotional abuse, eventually escapes, and returns to her former life. The sole scholarly discussion about these memoirs frames them as empowering for the authors, but the social and economic factors that inform these texts remain unaddressed. Drawing from Michel Foucault's discussion of the confession, this article complicates and extends this analysis. First, it situates memoirs by Elizabeth Smart, Amanda Berry and Gena DeJesus, Jaycee Dugard, Michelle Knight, and Josefina Rivera as examples of the Foucauldian sexual confession. It then maps the ways memoirs enable the authors to voice their understanding of the social and economic factors that both gave rise to their plight and inform media discussions that blame them for their suffering. I will ultimately argue that memoirs function as a public venue to resist or reject dominant interpretive frames that shape a survivor's experiences, while simultaneously reaffirming the ubiquity of these lines of thinking.

HYPATIA-A JOURNAL OF FEMINIST PHILOSOPHY			English	Article							BIAS	Professional philosophy in the US remains relatively homogenous. I use four anecdotes to amplify some of the practices that may contribute to the dearth of underrepresented philosophers. Each anecdote highlights a different problemlack of proper mentoring, stereotype threat, difficulties navigating sexism, and a sense of exclusion. Although I discuss each of these issues separately, it is certainly the case that these (and other issues) can and often do occur concurrently. I offer preliminary thoughts on how these problems could be addressed while keeping in mind that philosophy in the US is a microcosm of the larger US society.

J	Pena-Guzman, DM; Spera, R				Pena-Guzman, David M.; Spera, Rebekah			The Philosophical Personality	HYPATIA-A JOURNAL OF FEMINIST PHILOSOPHY			English	Article							WOMEN	The authors adopt a critico-sociological methodology to investigate the current state of the philosophical profession. According to them, the question concerning the status of philosophy (What is philosophy?) cannot be answered from within the precinct of philosophical reason alone, since philosophyunderstood primarily as a professionis marked by a constitutive type of self-ignorance that prevents it from reflecting upon its own sociological conditions of actuality. This ignorance, which is both cause and effect of the organization and investment of philosophical desire, causes philosophers to lose themselves in an ideological myth (the philosopher as idea(l)) according to which philosophers are unaffected by the material conditions in which they exist. This myth prevents philosophers from noticing the extent to which their activity is influenced by extra-philosophical determinants that shape, empirically, who becomes a professional philosopher (the philosopher as imago) and who doesn't. This article explores the relationship between philosophy's idea(l) and its imago as a way of shedding light on some of the mechanisms that make philosophy inhospitable for so many women, people of color, and economic minorities.

Our study proceeds in three steps. Step one: we estimate the percentage of women who specialize in ethics. Step two: we estimate the percentage of articles in prestigious ethics journals that are authored by women. Step three: we examine whether there is any difference between the percentage of women who specialize in ethics and the percentage of articles in prestigious ethics journals that are authored by women. We conclude that women are underrepresented in prestigious ethics journals relative to their representation in the field of ethics.

This lends credence to pre-university effects hypotheses of women's underrepresentation in philosophy and successfully replicates a smaller analysis performed by Cheshire Calhoun at Colby College in 2009. I also defend my analysis against an objection that claims that intention to major is not a good predictor of final major selection. Finally, I argue that this new analysis should lead to further investment in university-level diversity programs.

Such constraints channel women's time away from politics, but neither do they account for the whole difference, which calls for an additional explanation, identified with specific cultural constraints. As expected, there is a remarkable gap between women and men in traditional time-consuming political activities and situational constraints have a negative impact on women's participation, and surprisingly also have a negative effect on men's involvement.

SOCIAL POLITICS			English	Article							LINEAR PROBABILITY MODEL; GENDER-GAP; SWEDEN; CULTURE; WOMEN; LABOR; WORK	The gender differences in labor force participation and take-up of parental leave are accentuated in immigrant populations. This study examines whether certain policy features of parental leave are effective in leveling out the gendered differences among immigrants. We compare two distinct policy contexts, Finland and Sweden, and analyze the impacts of three policy reforms. Our results imply that policy features such as the earmarking of days and flexibility are the reason why immigrant fathers' take-up of leave is higher in Sweden. However, analysis of policy reforms suggests that other contextual factors also play a role.

It examines how state actors and institutions translate gender mainstreaming and work-family balance in the Turkish policy context. Approaching the state as a multi-layered and hierarchical set of institutions and practices, we trace the emergence of a policy architecture that marginalizes questions of women's employment and gender equality. Our goal is to shed light on how state actors and institutions actively participate in vernacularizing transnational gender policy norms and, in the process, bend these norms so far that they produce contradictory meanings and practices.

Ten women were asked in semi-structured interviews to reflect on how they came to understand constraints in their sex lives, and how they have negotiated these constraints. Four themes emerged in regards to women's habiti, reflecting prevailing discourses of heteronormativity. However despite Bourdieu's scepticism of change, the data also suggests that women are challenging these notions, albeit in ambivalent and uneven ways, through a process of critical reflexivity, sitting with vulnerability, and the adoption of alternative discourses. These stories suggest Bourdieu's concepts are insufficient for understanding women's capacity to resist heteronormativity within the habitus without further development by feminist scholars.

Sample characteristics, bivariate associations, and multivariate analyses were conducted. Three types of IPV were examined as predictors of different types of contraceptive use/intention. Results from multinomial logistic regressions indicated that if lifetime prevalence of physical violence, past-year physical violence, and emotional violence increased by one unit each, the relative risk for using modern methods of contraception increased significantly by a factor of 3.15, 2.75 and 3.44 respectively. If lifetime prevalence of physical violence and past-year physical violence increased by one unit each, the relative risk for using traditional methods of contraception increased significantly by a factor of 4.02 and 2.34. If lifetime prevalence of physical violence and emotional violence increased by one unit each, the relative risk for intending to use contraceptives increased significantly by a factor of 2.42 and 1.97 respectively.

Through the commercialization of agriculture, employment opportunities inside and outside the sector are expected to be created. Both women and men are integrated into this new agriculture production system. Based on a mixed-method approach, this paper provides insights into current transformations of the rural labour market. The feminization debates build the theoretical background. The empirical results show that wage employment is created almost exclusively in the informal sector, typically for casual on-field agriculture workers. It is apparent that for the same work, women earn approximately 20% less than men. Women play an important role in the rural labour market while carrying the main bulk of reproductive work. The agricultural transformation is gendered, and due to reproductive work, women do not have the same opportunities in the paid labour market.

To explore the effects of organic farming initiatives on the empowerment of women as perceived by female farmers, a qualitative field study with interviews in Odisha (India) was conducted. Results show that, although organic farming has positive impacts on women, such as improvements in health and food security, there are significant drawbacks due to factors such as the additional workload. Women are also widely excluded from business decisions in organic farming, as the investigated organic initiative works within traditional gender patterns. Although female farmer groups exist, women are neither included on the cooperative level nor in agricultural training on organic methods, which leads to the reinforcement of deeply embedded gender inequality. Fully exploiting the potential for empowering women through organic farming and increasing gender equality in India would require technical training and working beyond traditional social structures, to include women in higher administrative levels.

This study aims to improve the status of Moroccan female university teachers by informing on the opinion of the university teaching staff themselves. A mixed methodology was used, with interviews and a questionnaire distributed among 143 male and female teachers. Variables associated with a greater perception of this problem were detected: marital status, holding a post in the administration and age. Despite the undoubted advances in Moroccan universities in terms of gender equity, we identify two groups of teachers with opposing views. Some reported blatant gender inequity, among which we highlight a greater awareness of the youngest teachers, while others were not aware of the problem and did not admit its existence. This problem should not be overlooked.

Addressing the need for biographies about contemporary Buddhist nuns, and on helping these women to find their voices, this biographical narrative study documents and explores the life stories of a group of Vajrayana nuns residing in a Buddhist abbey in Kathmandu, Nepal. This study centers on concepts of empowerment but aims to explore how a group of contemporary nuns are utilizing and redefining their situated empowerment within their religious community and beyond. Through hi-depth interviews, this research examines ways in which these contemporary nuns exercise and contest power within a Buddhist institution, predicated on core religious teachings that profess egalitarianism yet situated within a larger sociocultural milieu that is notoriously oppressive to women and girls. It explores what empowerment opportunities and challenges they face as twenty-first century nuns, and how their roles and identities as Buddhist nuns are evolving in increasingly empowering ways.

Acknowledging an intricately interwoven history of the (Western-led) international women's movement, it shows how women in the interwar period networked across continental, regional, and national, as well as ethnic, linguistic, racial, and religious divides. The All-Asian Women's Conference that convened in British India in 1931 serves as an example thereof Its objectives were to appreciate the qualities of what attendees identified as Asian womanhood in light of an international sisterhood and to speak in a unified voice on international and national political platforms. Notwithstanding the ephemerality of this pan-Asian project, its spirit may well be understood as international feminist, offering Third World and transnational feminist scholarship a historical account of an instance of women's international organizing headquartered in Asia.

J	Ishikawa, T				Ishikawa, Tadashi			HUMAN TRAFFICKING AND INTRA-IMPERIAL KNOWLEDGE: Adopted Daughters, Households, and Law in Imperial Japan and Colonial Taiwan, 1919-1935	JOURNAL OF WOMENS HISTORY			English	Article								In the early 1920s, the League of Nations embarked on regulating human trafficking as a social problem and questioned colonial empires about how to regulate it within and outside of their territories. As this question affected the Japanese empire and colonial Taiwan (1895-1945), the metropolitan government utilized the international discourse about human trafficking to construct regulations for the border-crossing prostitution of under-age women. This translation of the international discourse about human trafficking enabled Japan to preserve adult prostitution and freed colonial Taiwan from the related effects of Japan's international agreement. These maneuvers also encouraged officials and the press based in Japan and Taiwan to associate prostitution with daughter adoption and further child abuse and parental authority, redefining the ideal of free will and movement. This article examines how Japanese criticisms of human trafficking evolved and intertwined in the Japanese colonial courts that adjudicated the adoption of Taiwanese daughters into households.

J	King, MT				King, Michelle T.			MARGARET SANGER IN TRANSLATION: Gender, Class, and Birth Control in 1920s China	JOURNAL OF WOMENS HISTORY			English	Article								During her first and only successful lecture tour in China in 1922, Margaret Sanger set out to enlighten Chinese audiences by sharing information from the West about the modern, scientific practice of birth control. But the lines of communication were not so transparent, and her Chinese interlocutors were not only passive recipients in the process. This article highlights how gender and class identities critically affected the translation of Sanger's message about birth control, through an analysis of Sanger's autobiographical writings and coverage of her visit in Chinese periodicals. Although Sanger was keen to limit the fertility of lower-class Chinese women, for the most part her contraceptive message resonated among educated, middle-class Chinese men. Focusing on the influence of these varied gender and class identities allows us to delimit the boundaries of birth control discourse for educated Chinese women, who are otherwise largely absent from the historical record.

J	Jordan, D				Jordan, Deborah			THE ROLE OF PETITIONS IN THE MOBILIZATION OF WOMEN FOR THE RIGHT TO VOTE: The Case of Queensland, Australia, 1894, 1897	JOURNAL OF WOMENS HISTORY			English	Article							SUFFRAGE	Women across the western world began to focus on obtaining the vote in the last decades of the nineteenth century. One of the first strategies of the specifically dedicated Women's Equal Franchise Association (WEFA) in Brisbane, Australia was to collect signatures calling for "one woman, one vote." The very wording of the petition became a point of contention in challenges over leadership of the new association. A subsequent, non-partisan breakaway group formed and also collected signatures. This article addresses the initiation, collection, and submission of the WEFA petition and the 1897 petition collected by the Woman's Christian Temperance Union (WCTU). Addressing forms of political intervention amid contentious politics allows a more nuanced analysis of the broader women's movement's engagement with petitions, which were crucial in the formation of the more narrowly focused associations and participants' ongoing strategies. The often-vituperative representation of suffragists in the press highlights their achievements in mobilizing mass support for the vote and establishing a measure of legitimacy.

J	Mondal, S				Mondal, Sharleen			HINDU WIDOWS AS RELIGIOUS SUBJECTS: The Politics of Christian Conversion and Revival in Colonial India	JOURNAL OF WOMENS HISTORY			English	Article								This article examines how the Maharashtrian Hindu widow and convert to Christianity, Ramabai Dongre Medhavi (1858-1922), and the students at her widows' school, Mukti Mission, contributed to early twentieth-century social reform in colonial India. This article specifically examines the 1905-1907 religious revival at Mukti Mission and poses two main arguments. First, the revival constituted a rejection of the constraints prescribed to Hindu widows under an oppressive orthodox Brahmin patriarchy. Second, despite its contestation of patriarchy, the revival narrative adopted by the Mukti women was fraught with imperial and racial hierarchies, limiting the gains wrought by the revival's resistance of patriarchal constraints. These limitations are evident in Ramabai's critique of the US and British missionary discourses that questioned the legitimacy of the Mukti revival in imperial and sexist terms. These two arguments provide deeper insight into the role of the religious practices and identities of Hindu widows who converted to Christianity in the emergence of Indian feminism.

This article examines the unfolding of the Baha'i laws of divorce in the context of the relevant Islamic laws prevalent in Iran Islamic laws that were highly gender-discriminatory and have remained largely unchanged. By significantly raising the stakes for men seeking divorce and by granting women in troubled marriages greater rights and more options, the Baha'i laws made women less subject to the whims of their husbands. These laws, together with other Baha'i laws and teachings like monogamy and the provision of institutional oversight over marriage and divorce, redefined marriage as an institution with greater safeguards for the rights of wives. This article also looks at the role of the Baha'i administrative system in securing for women access to their rights under Baha'i law in relation to divorce.

POLITICS & GENDER			English	Article							TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE; CONGO; CONFLICT; RAPE	During armed conflicts, women experience extensive gender harm of a physical, sexual, legal, economic, social, cultural, and political nature. Recently, however, we have witnessed unprecedented attention in international law and policy-making arenas to the specific issue of sexual violence as a strategy of warfare. This has been particularly obvious in the agenda on women, peace, and security. Since 2008, the United Nations agenda has increasingly and repeatedly focused on sexual violence in armed conflicts in several Security Council resolutions, calling on and pressuring member states and international agencies to address this issue using militaristic and legalistic strategies. In this article, looking particularly at the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), I argue that the prioritization of sexual harm over other forms of gender harm has had a detrimental impact on women living in aid-dependent societies, and the international obsession with sexual harm has delivered neither justice nor security for victims in the DRC. The article concludes that in order to effectively address sexual violence, we have to rethink sexual harm as gender harm and start listening and responding to women's actual needs and priorities on the ground.

J	Meijs, MHJ; Ratliff, KA; Lammers, J				Meijs, Maartje H. J.; Ratliff, Kate A.; Lammers, Joris			The Discrepancy Between How Women See Themselves and Feminists Predicts Identification with Feminism	SEX ROLES			English	Article						Feminismm; Self-conceptm; Group identitym; Stereotyped attitudesm; Stereotype content model	PRESCRIPTIVE GENDER STEREOTYPES; SOCIAL IDENTITY; POLITICAL ORIENTATION; UNIVERSAL DIMENSIONS; IMPRESSION-FORMATION; COLLECTIVE ACTION; ATTITUDES; SELF; COMPETENCE; WARMTH	Many women who accept the basic tenets of feminist ideology are reluctant to call themselves feminists, which is problematic because feminist self-identification is related to a variety of positive outcomes. The present research tests the idea that discrepancies between women's self-view and feminist-view on the dimensions of competence and warmth are related to identification with feminism. This supposition is guided by the idea that a full understanding of why women have difficulty embracing feminism must take into account not only their view of feminists, but also whether women see themselves as different from feminists. Three online survey studies, which included 387, 288, and 116 adult U.S. women, demonstrate that perception of warmth identification with feminism was lower if women regard feminists as less warm than they see themselves. For perceptions of competence, the direction of this discrepancy was irrelevant: The more women see feminists as differently competent (i.e., higher or lower), the less they identify with feminists. Moreover, perceived discrepancy predicted identification with feminism even after controlling for women's agreement with feminist values. Both endorsement of feminist values and perceived discrepancy are important in predicting identification with feminism and therefore practical interventions to maximize identification should target both of these components. For perceived discrepancy, interventions to reduce feminist-self discrepancies will likely be most effective if they target stereotypes of feminists as being cold.	[Meijs, Maartje H.

There is thus considerable need to examine how ideological processes surrounding women's status and value can be challenged. In the current study we used mixed method analyses to examine a process of deideologization-the contestation and transformation of traditional ideology-among a group of Maasai women in northern Tanzania. First, thematic analysis was used to analyze qualitative interviews conducted with 16 Maasai women. Themes involving traditional ideology, the value of popular education, and components of a deideologization process were identified and assessed. Second, quantitative structural equation modeling was used to test a process model connecting women's participation in popular education classes to increased political efficacy, decreased discomfort speaking at community meetings, and, in turn, deceased patriarchal beliefs about women. Overall, findings provided evidence for an iterative deideologization process catalyzed by popular education that led to improvements in women's lives. The importance of promoting processes of deideologization via locally driven efforts to improve the status and well-being of women are discussed.

Despite the impact and popularity of the OBCS, however, investigations of its factor structure have been limited. To our knowledge, the present study is the first since the instrument's development 20 years ago to provide a detailed evaluation of the replicability of the factor structure of OBCS data in a sample of U.S. college women, the population for which the measure was originally developed and is used most frequently. Specifically, we used confirmatory factor analyses to evaluate the structure of OBCS data and identify areas for measure refinement. Internal consistency reliability and convergent validity were also examined. A sample of 368 U.S. college women completed the OBCS along with measures of body esteem and thin-ideal internalization as convergent validity indicators. Findings revealed that OBCS Control Beliefs items were poor indicators of the factor. A two-factor structure composed of Body Surveillance and Body Shame was supported. Support for internal consistency reliability and convergent validity was also garnered. Additionally, abbreviated versions of the Body Surveillance and Body Shame subscales produced good model-data fit without sacrificing reliability or validity. These results support the use of the OBCS Body Surveillance and Body Shame subscales to assess critical aspects of body image in research and practice contexts; the abbreviated versions of these subscales can address demands for brevity in these contexts.

The current study examined this association and considered current body image shame and self-criticism as mediators. A multi-group path analysis was conducted to examine gender differences in these relationships. The sample included 222 women and 109 men from the Portuguese general and college student populations who recalled an early body image-focused shame experience and completed measures of the centrality of the shame memory, current body image shame, binge eating symptoms, depressive symptoms, and self-criticism. For both men and women, the effect of the centrality of shame memories related to body image on binge eating symptoms was fully mediated by body image shame and self-criticism. In women, these effects were further mediated by self-criticism focused on a sense of inadequacy and also on self-hatred. In men, only the form of self-criticism focused on a sense of inadequacy mediated these associations. The present study has important implications for the conceptualization and treatment of binge eating symptoms. Findings suggest that, in both genders, body image-focused shame experiences are associated with binge eating symptoms via their effect on current body image shame and self-criticism.

In the present study, Italian participants (78 men; 81 women) were exposed to a nature TV documentary (Control video), a television clip portraying women as sexual objects (SO video), or to the same sexually objectifying television clip including a commentary against such degrading depiction of women (Critique SO video). After exposure to the Critique SO video, women, but not men, reported greater collective action proclivity and behavioral intention to support a protest against female sexual objectification, as compared to the Control condition. Importantly, results further demonstrated that anger was the mechanism underlying women's collective action proclivity, as well as intention to react. These findings suggest that media literacy messages in the form of critique videos may be valuable tools to promote more active and critical media consumption and that media specialists, concerned citizens, and social media activists may use such messages to motivate women to collectively take action against sexual objectification.

To this end, the presence of men and women on two female- and two male-targeted Dutch channels (N = 115 programs, N = 1091 persons) were compared via content analysis. The expectation that men's channels would portray a less equal and more traditional image of gender than women's channels was generally supported by the results. Regardless of genre as well as country of origin of the program, women were underrepresented on men's channels, while gender distribution on women's channels was more equal. The representation of women in terms of age and occupation was more stereotypical on men's channels than on women's channels, whereas men were represented in more contra-stereotypical ways (e.g., performing household tasks) on women's channels. Since television viewing contributes to the learning and maintenance of stereotyped perceptions, the results imply that it is important to strengthen viewers' defenses against the effects of gender stereotyping when watching gendered television channels, for instance through media literacy programs in schools.

The purpose of the present study was to examine health status, as well as barriers and motives for physical activity, among low-income, Black single mothers from an intersectionality framework. Participants (n = 32) in this cross-sectional, mixed methods study completed questionnaires to assess physical activity, health status, stress, and barriers to physical activity and then participated in one of six focus groups to explore physical activity motives and barriers. Although participants reported many risk factors for disease including obesity, stress, and family disease history, most participants were not engaging in behaviors that would improve health such as regular leisure-time physical activity. Participants cited being a role model, stress relief, and weight loss as motives for physical activity that were connected to their social identities as low-income, Black single mothers. Chronic stress and stressors, responsibilities associated with single motherhood, and lack of social and community supports were described as barriers to physical activity. Future researchers and practitioners should consider these specific motives and barriers when designing interventions to increase physical activity among low-income, Black single mothers. We recommend that these programs focus on: promoting motives for physical activity that are meaningful and specific to this subpopulation of mothers, reducing stress, and enhancing affordable physical activity opportunities in the community for single mothers and their children.

We use data collected from face-to-face interviews with ten African American women athletic directors of NCAA Division I, II, and III U.S. intercollegiate athletic departments. Findings of our investigation reveal that the intersection of their race and gender identities, in conjunction with societal and occupational stereotypes, resulted in many of them working in environments where they faced constant challenges to their identity and authority in response to social and occupational stereotypes, misperceptions concerning their leadership roles, and perceptions that their hiring is more a result of their demographics than of their qualifications. We highlight the importance of recognizing how stereotypes intersect to produce differential experiences, and we seek to increase awareness of how implicit stereotyping influences the thoughts and behaviors of African American women athletic directors and also the individuals interacting with them. Our findings have implications for the well-being, recruitment and retention of African American women in leadership positions.

When Women are Urged to have Casual Sex More than Men are: Perceived Risk Moderates the Sexual Advice Double Standard	SEX ROLES			English	Article						Sexual double standards; Gender gap; Human sexuality; Gender equality; Risk assessment	GENDER-DIFFERENCES; SOCIAL NORM; YOUNG MEN; BEHAVIOR; CONSEQUENCES; PERCEPTIONS; COLLEGE; IMPACT; TALK; RAPE	Sociocultural and biological frameworks suggest a Sexual Advice Double Standard (SADS; wherein heterosexual men are encouraged to have causal sex more than heterosexual women are) motivated by intransigent factors (e.g., patriarchy or evolved dispositions). Alternatively, people generally perceive casual sex as riskier for women, who may be discouraged from sex to protect them from stigma and danger (Rudman et al. 2013). If so, manipulating perceived risk to reduce or reverse the costs of casual sex for men and for women should eliminate or reverse the SADS, respectively. Results investigating American adults (N = 180) supported risk assessment's explanatory power. When costs to both partners were mild, the SADS was eliminated, but when costs to men were higher, women were urged to have casual sex more than men were. The SADS emerged only when costs to women were higher. The findings have implications for gender equality and sexuality theories, but also practitioners (e.g., therapists, sex educators, and physicians). The SADS is far from intractable, but believing in rigid sexual double standards creates psychological conflict in women caught between motives to be seen as moral and sexually desirable, which negatively impacts their sexual health (e.g., Katz and Farrow 2000).

Female heterosexual undergraduates (N = 221) provided self-report data on multiple attachment orientations underlying attachment styles, sexual motives, and hookup behavior. Proximity-seeking (i.e., turning toward others to share experiences and in times of need) and self-reliance (i.e., preferring not to ask for help or to depend on others) were both associated with number of hookup partners. Sexual motives mediated some of these relationships. Intimacy motives explained how proximity-seeking positively related to hookup behavior, whereas enhancement motives explained how self-reliance negatively related to hookup behavior. These results suggest that attachment orientations associated with both secure and insecure attachment styles predict women's casual sexual behavior through different sexual motives. These results also suggest that women's casual sexual encounters do not necessarily reflect insecurity, dysfunction, psychopathology, or maladaptation. To promote healthy hookup behaviors among women, both emotional as well as sexual needs associated with different attachment orientations should be considered.

Myths of Sexual Economics Theory: Implications for Gender Equality	PSYCHOLOGY OF WOMEN QUARTERLY			English	Article						sexual economics theory; close relationships; human sexuality; gender equality	AMBIVALENT SEXISM; BENEVOLENT SEXISM; RISK PERCEPTION; DOUBLE-STANDARD; FETTEROLF 2014; SOCIAL NORMS; RAPE MYTHS; WOMEN; ATTITUDES; MEN	The authors of sexual economics theory (Baumeister & Twenge, 2002; Baumeister & Vohs, 2004) argue that sex is a female commodity that women exchange for men's resources; therefore, women (not men) are responsible for the cultural suppression of sexuality, ostensibly to preserve the value of sex. In this article, I describe the central tenets of sexual economics theory and summarize a growing body of research contradicting them. I also explain the negative implications of the claims of sexual economics theory for gender equality and heterosexual relationships. Researchers, clinicians, and educators engaged in understanding human sexuality may use the arguments provided in this article to counteract gender myths. This article also serves as a case study of how feminist scholars can employ empirical evidence to weaken a popularized, patriarchal theory.

Supporting our hypotheses, results indicated that higher levels of SOREs were positively correlated with waitresses' anxiety and disordered eating. Our findings also supported a theorized four-chain mediation model in which higher levels of SOREs were related to both anxiety and disordered eating directly and indirectly via, in serial: less organizational power, less personal power and control, and more rumination. In addition, SOREs and a lack of organizational power had direct, unique links to rumination. Our findings highlight the importance of both contextual and intrapersonal factors in understanding waitresses' mental health problems. These findings underscore the need to implement both system-level and individual-level interventions to combat the existence of SOREs and the negative effects these environments may have on women who work in the industry.

The aim of the current study was to examine a dual-path model and to test the relations between childhood maltreatment, shame, and well-being as mediated by both self-objectification and a sense of disrupted body boundaries among 531 female college/university students living in Israel. Results from the structural equation modeling analyses indicated that both self-objectification and disrupted body boundaries significantly mediated the association between childhood maltreatment and sense of shame. In addition, both were associated with reduced levels of well-being, through the mediating role of shame. Finally, we discuss the role these paths may play in the detrimental long-term effects of childhood maltreatment and how they may be targeted in clinical interventions for adult survivors.

In the current study, we showed that objectifying media affected people's intervention when they witnessed a harassment episode. After exposure to objectifying TV or to a control video, Italian participants (N = 126) took part in what they believed to be an employment interview that occurred by computer chat between a male interviewer and a female job applicant; participants could intervene at any time in the conversation. Participants exposed to the objectifying TV (vs. control) video were less likely to intervene and took more time before intervening in the interview in which the interviewer engaged in harassing behavior. They also reported perceiving harassment at a later stage in the interview. We discuss the role of media in creating a normative context that condones harassing behavior, and we suggest potential training programs to increase bystanders' intervention when sexual harassment occurs.

We extended this perception to gender and tested whether American national identity is constructed in masculine, versus feminine, terms. We examined whether U.S. men feel greater symbolic ownership over the nation and represent what it means to be a prototypical American, more than U.S. women. In Study 1, men and women considered male-associated traits more American than female-associated traits and listed more men as examples of true Americans than women. In Study 2, men reported higher levels of nationalism than women. Women's nationalism was moderated by their conception of male-associated traits as Americanwomen who viewed American identity as more masculine were less nationalistic. Men showed a stronger correlation between gender identity and American identity compared to women. However, correlations between gender identity and nationalism did not differ by participant gender. Results suggest men and masculinity are considered more American than are women and femininity. We provide support for the subgroup asymmetry hypothesis through the novel lens of gender. We discuss means of attenuating the gendered construction of national identity in terms of media, policy, and education.

Employing a community-based collaborative approach, we constructed a community-informed socioecological conceptual model from a feminist perspective, detailing how armed conflict relates to GBV in a conflict-affected rural community in Northeastern Uganda. The research questions were as follows: (1) How does the community conceptualize GBV? and (2) How does armed conflict relate to GBV? Nine focus group discussions divided by gender, age, and profession and six key informant interviews were conducted. Participants' ages ranged from 9 to 80 years (n = 34 girls/women, n = 43 boys/men). Grounded theory was used in analysis. Participants conceptualized eight forms of and 22 interactive variables that contributed to GBV. Armed conflict affected physical violence/quarreling, sexual violence, early marriage, and land grabbing via a direct pathway and four indirect pathways initiated through looting of resources, militarization of the community, death of a parent(s) or husband, and sexual violence. The findings suggest that community, organizational, and policy-level interventions, which include attention to intersecting vulnerabilities for exposure to GBV in conflict-affected settings, should be prioritized. While tertiary psychological interventions with women and girls affected by GBV in these areas should not be eliminated, we suggest that policy makers and members of community and organizational efforts make systemic and structural changes.

Steps taken by the government are usually in response to pressure from international donors and rights groups. However, there seem to be important contextual and sociocultural differences at play when it comes to how gender equality is to be achieved in organizational practice. Such differences, as well as an apparent lack of genuine commitment at the policy level, may explain why there remains a gap between the policy and praxis of gender equality in Pakistan. Informed by structural and relational perspectives of gender, this article draws on in-depth qualitative interviews with female employees to explore the multilevel issues related to gender equality at the macro-national, meso-organizational and micro-individual levels. In particular, it highlights such issues as societal norms of female modesty and gender segregation (macro), sexual harassment, career-related challenges and income gap (meso), and family status and agency (micro).

By jointly examining how gender and dis-/ability are addressed, shaped and coconstituted by practices labelled as diversity management, this study aims to paint a finer-grained picture of the inclusionary potential of the diversity turn'. It offers a comparative analysis of two diversity dimensions' that are assumed to be opposing in terms of social desirability or economic exploitability. It thereby provides insight into the inclusionary and exclusionary dynamics of diversity management. Based on interviews in for-profit and non-profit organizations in Austria and Germany, the study reveals persistent, unequal dynamics of inclusion and exclusion: while the inclusion of supposedly non-disabled women and men with female-associated living conditions' revolves around a mostly undisputed gender-equality norm, the inclusion of disabled people depends on specific conditions and is not taken for granted.

While praxis has been theorized in feminist theory in relation to knowledge, standpoint and bodies, literature neglects how whiteness structures the production of knowledge and praxis. I argue that an understanding of white praxis should entail an examination of white epistemology, white ignorance and encounters with the stranger. At the same time, heeding critical race theorists' cautions about critical whiteness studies and white feminism, I propose ways in which listening could begin to work as a form of white praxis responding to racism in research on diversity and organizations.

In this context, the availability of defenses including provocation and self-defense for abused defendants is controversially debated due to their traditional application and interpretation. It appears that these cases have driven law reform and changed judicial interpretation of defenses to some degree in Australia, whereas the situation in Germany remains stagnant. This article argues that while the situation in Australia is not without criticism, the recent legislative developments aimed at affording abused defendants greater access to defenses could serve as food for legal thought in the German debate.

Intersectional Masculinities and Gendered Political Consciousness: How Do Race, Ethnicity and Sexuality Shape Men's Awareness of Gender Inequality and Support for Gender Activism?

The present study draws from social psychology, theories of masculinities, and intersectionality to assess the factors associated with men's political consciousness of gender. Multivariate regression analyses of data from the U.S.-based 2012 Evaluations of Government and Society Study (N = 598) (American National Election American National Election Study 2012) highlights how social statuses of race/ethnicity and sexuality-along with beliefs about racial/ethnic and sexuality-based inequalities-correlate with men's awareness of gender inequality and support for women fighting for greater gender equality. Results show that Non-Hispanic Black men and married men are significantly more likely than are non-Hispanic White men and unmarried men to see high levels of gender inequality. Men who see high levels of racial/ethnic and sexuality-based inequalities are also significantly more likely to perceive high levels of gender inequality. Bivariate analyses show that Non-Hispanic Black men, as well as men who see high levels of other inequalities, are also more likely than are other men to support women fighting for greater gender equality, but in multivariate regression models these effects are eclipsed by political ideology-the single best predictor of men's support for women fighting for gender equality. Results underscore the need to differentiate awareness of gender inequality and support for efforts to challenge gender inequality, and they highlight the potential of intersectionality for conceptualizing men's gendered political consciousness.

The Patriarchal Bargain in a Context of Rapid Changes to Normative Gender Roles: Young Arab Women's Role Conflict in Qatar	SEX ROLES			English	Article						Emerging adulthood; Islam; Middle East; Patriarchy; Qualitative research; Sex roles; Social norms; Transition to adulthood	INTIMATE PARTNER VIOLENCE; MIDDLE-EAST; FAMILY; RIGHTS; ISLAM; INEQUALITY; UNIVERSITY; CULTURE; EGYPT	Social norms in patriarchal countries in the Middle East are changing at differing rates. In Qatar, expectations about education have shifted, and women's participation in higher education is normative. However, women's participation in the workforce remains relatively low, and women still are expected to perform all household and child-rearing activities. Interviews with 27 18-25 year-old Qatari women enrolled in college in Qatar are used to illustrate the conflict between norms about education, workforce, and family. Many young women resolve this normative conflict by giving preference to family over work and education. Other women hold conflicting norms and goals for their future without acknowledging the normative conflict. Overall, young women in this sample feared divorce, were uncertain about customary family safety nets, and thus desired financial independence so they would be able to support themselves if they were left alone later in life due to divorce, or the death of their husband. The Qatari government should revisit the appropriateness of continuing to emphasize the patriarchal family structure and socially conservative family norms, if they desire to advance women in their society.

Gender Roles in the Arab World: Development and Psychometric Properties of the Arab Adolescents Gender Roles Attitude Scale	SEX ROLES			English	Article						Adolescence; Sexism; Gender roles; Arab; Egalitarian; Measurement; Sex-role attitudes	AMBIVALENT SEXISM; LEBANESE STUDENTS; FAMILY ROLES; VALIDATION; BELIEFS; WOMEN	Scant research has been conducted on gender in the Arab world; one explanation is due to a lack of Arabic measures on gender-related issues. To advance scientific work on gender in the Arab world, we developed the Arab Adolescents Gender Roles Attitude Scale (AAGRAS), the first known reliable and valid Arabic measure of gender-role attitudes. To develop this measure, we conducted two studies based on data collected from 776 high school students 15-19 years-old from the state of Qatar. Exploratory factor analysis and confirmatory factor analysis produced 12 items divided equally into two subscales. One subscale assesses traditional gender-role attitudes, whereas the other measures egalitarian gender-role attitudes. Our findings indicate that young men are more likely to resist gender equality than young women are. Moreover, those who hold traditional attitudes are more likely to disapprove of women occupying positions of authority. The AAGRAS is a useful assessment tool that policymakers, researchers, practitioners, and educators can use to study gender-role attitudes in the Arab world and to develop educational and intervention programs that encourage adolescents to identify, confront, and avoid prejudice and discrimination against women and ultimately adopt more egalitarian gender roles.

Initial Development of a Gendered-Racial Socialization Scale for African American College Women	SEX ROLES			English	Article						African American; Women; Socialization; Intersectionality	WOMANIST IDENTITY ATTITUDES; SELF-ESTEEM; ETHNIC SOCIALIZATION; LOW-INCOME; PARENTS; EXPERIENCES; FAMILIES; RACE; DISCRIMINATION; MESSAGES	As research exploring the racial-ethnic socialization practices of African American families continues to expand, scholars have argued for a more multidimensional approach in the measurement of racial-ethnic socialization that focuses on the influence that youths' gender may have on the messages families provide. Although studies have used current racial-ethnic socialization measures to examine gender differences in the messages youth receive, these studies are limited in investigating intersectional messages that African American girls and women receive regarding racial and gender identities. The present preliminary study sought to address this inadequacy by developing the Gendered Racial-Ethnic Socialization Scale for Black Women (GRESS-BW), a scale that accounts for the unique messages African American young women receive regarding their intersectional identities. Utilizing a sample of 174 African American college women, Exploratory Factor Analysis indicated that the GRESS-BW consisted of 63 items with a 9-factor solution. There was strong internal consistency for the GRESS-BW factors and the total scale. GRESS-BW construct validity assessment revealed that several of the factors were significantly positively related to a racial-ethnic socialization scale. However, only two components were significantly related to a gender-role socialization measure. Clinical and research implications are discussed.

We examined three variants of daily relational sacrifices: frequency, ease, and awareness for both individuals and partners, and we tested for gender differences. Using an Actor Partner Interdependence Model (APIM), we found that both women and men reported lower variability in commitment when men were perceived as highly aware of the sacrifices made for them. Additionally, women experienced lower variability in commitment when their male partners reported engaging in easier sacrifices. In contrast, women reported higher variability in commitment when they reported greater frequency of sacrifices for their partner. The results can be of practical use for practitioners working with expectant cohabitors and their partners given the unique role gender plays relative to how sacrifices shape variability in daily commitment.

The present study examined the traditional female role, understood here as the adoption of passive and submissive traits specific to Mexican women, as another risk factor for postpartum depressive symptomatology that interacts with social support. Using two waves of data from a longitudinal study of 210 adult Mexican women (20-44 years-old, M-age = 29.50 years, SD = 6.34), we found that lacking social support during the third trimester of their pregnancy was associated with greater depressive symptoms at 6 months in the postpartum, although this relationship depended on the level of endorsement of the traditional female role during pregnancy. Lower social support during pregnancy predicted greater postpartum depressive symptoms for women with higher endorsement of the traditional female role, even when accounting for prenatal depressive symptoms. These results suggest that Mexican women's experience of social support may depend on their individual adherence to gender roles. Understanding the association between women's traditional roles and social support in the risk for postpartum depression can improve prevention and educational programs for women at risk.

The goal of the present study was to determine whether minority stress, specifically internalized homophobia, predicted unwanted sexual experiences among LGBQ undergraduates (N = 763), whether routine behaviors (number of consensual sexual partners and alcohol use) mediated this relationship, and whether sense of LGBTQ community was a protective factor. Significant proportions of sexual minority men (10 %), women (18 %), and non-binary or transitioning students (19%) reported an unwanted sexual experience since entering college. Internalized homophobia was associated with greater risk of unwanted sexual experiences. It also had a negative indirect effect on unwanted sexual experience risk through a negative association with number of sexual partners. Alcohol use did not mediate the relationship between internalized homophobia and unwanted sexual experiences. Sense of LGBTQ community was associated with lower risk, mediated by lower levels of internalized homophobia. The relationships between internalized homophobia and unwanted sexual experience risk were similar for women and men. These findings demonstrate that minority stress increases LGBQ students' risk of sexual victimization and that in-group social relationships can mitigate this risk. We argue that minority stress is an important risk factor for sexual violence. Violence prevention interventions should attempt to reduce internalized homophobia, and colleges and high schools should establish LGBQ-affirming social climates and provide resources for LGBQ students, including targeted violence prevention efforts and programs that foster a sense of supportive community.

However, few studies examining college students' sexual experiences have focused on racial/ethnic minority populations. The present study uses sexual scripting frameworks and qualitative methods to provide an in-depth examination of the sexual initiation perceptions of 45 Hispanic college men who have sex with women. Two broad themes were uncovered: (a) men's perceptions about when sexual intercourse should first be initiated and (b) the kinds of behaviors men saw as appropriate for initiating sexual intimacy. Hispanic college men reported that the status of the relationship and partners' mutual desire most strongly influenced their decisions about when to initiate sex. Few men ascribed to a normative time frame for initiating sexual intercourse. The most commonly reported approach used to initiate sex was non-verbal communication, followed by indirect verbal communication, direct verbal communication, and waiting for the woman to initiate. Although machismo beliefs were acknowledged as part of men's cultural reference for masculinity, they felt they were not central to their own sexual initiation experiences or beliefs. Our findings advance our knowledge of the processes contributing to college men's personal desires and beliefs about engaging in sexual activity, which has important implications for developing effective campus-based efforts addressing the communication of sexual consent.

We investigated whether gender differences in mathematics motivation and socialisers' perceptions impacted choices for diverse STEM careers of varying mathematical intensity. Drawing on expectancy-value theory, we tested structural equation models in which adolescents' preferred careers related to each of physics, biology, chemistry, and mathematics were predicted by prior mathematical performance, motivations, and mothers' perceptions. We explored potential differences in gendered processes of influence using multigroup models. Samples were 331 Australian adolescents followed from 9th to 11th grade in 1998 and 277 U.S. adolescents from 9th to 12th grade in 2009-10. In both samples female adolescents preferred biological careers more than males did; male adolescents preferred physics-related careers and also mathematical careers in the Australian sample. Mothers' perceptions were important to female and male adolescents' mathematics motivations; gendered motivations were more evident in the Australian sample. Mathematics interest played the strongest role in male adolescents' preferred careers, whereas actual or perceived mathematical achievements were most important for females, demonstrating the impacts of mathematical motivations on preferences for diverse STEM careers.

The purpose of the present research was to contribute to an understanding of these gender differences. Four studies (total N = 494 U.S. undergraduates) administered a modified animal preference test in which participants could choose to be predator or prey animals, but not labeled as such. Men were consistently more interested in being predator animals than women were, displaying a sort of hostile dominance in their projective preferences. Predator self-identifications, in turn, mediated gender differences in outcomes related to hostile dominance. Studies 1 and 2 provided initial evidence for this model in the context of variations in interpersonal arrogance, and Studies 3 and 4 extended the model to nonverbal displays and daily life prosociality, respectively. The findings indicate that gender differences in hostile dominance are paralleled by gender differences in preferring to think about the self in predator-like terms. Accordingly, the findings provide new insights into aggressive forms of masculine behavior.

J	Bourgault, S				Bourgault, Sophie			Prolegomena to a caring bureaucracy	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF WOMENS STUDIES			English	Article						Bureaucracy; caring institutions; ethics of care; feminism; street-level bureaucrats	ORGANIZED DISSONANCE; FEMINIST BUREAUCRACY; ORGANIZATIONS; CARE	Bureaucracy has had few admirers, as a quick perusal of 20th-century political and social theory readily indicates. In recent years, several feminist theorists have also joined this vociferous anti-bureaucracy chorus, denouncing bureaucracy's excessively hierarchical, impersonal, cold and controlling nature. The goal of this article is to review these charges and to show why the term caring bureaucracy' is not an oxymoron. In the first two sections, the author considers the various reasons why bureaucratic structures are said to be bad both for the people who work in them (especially women) and for those who deal with them. The author proposes to discuss these charges in light of some research on feminist organizations and street-level bureaucracy (Ashcraft, Due Billing, Dubois). The intention is not to offer a paean to street-level discretion or to the claims of the heart' in public service; it is, rather, to underscore at once the beauty and the danger of discretion. It is also noted that feminist theorists ought to be cautious when they call for flattened hierarchies' and for fewer rules in large institutions - for these might work against the best interests of women. The last part of the article offers the outline of a caring bureaucracy and suggests avenues to be explored in future care ethics research.

Drawing on the problem approach to policy analysis, the article engages with the Equality Budget Statements (EBS) as policy documents that not only inform the government's spending plans but are foremost statements of values and norms pursued by the government. This critical reading reveals that certain discourses give different meanings to women's lives through the political significance of what remains unproblematized as part of the ensuing care discourse in Scotland. The developing discourse on economic policy and equality suggests that equality in Scotland is presupposed on labour market participation. This shrinks discourse on unpaid care work; the problem of unpaid care work is silenced, while the problem of women's access to employment is redefined to mean a problem of difference and costly childcare only. The way certain issues have or have not appeared in governmental documents is explanatory of the importance and relevance of unpaid care work to the political discourse.

Utilizing questionnaires, interviews and video diaries, it assesses how religious young adults understood and managed the tensions in popular discourse between gender equality as an enshrined value and aspirational narrative, and religion as purportedly instituting gender inequality. The article shows that, despite varied understandings, and the ambivalence and tension in managing ideal and practice, participants of different religious traditions and genders were committed to gender equality. Thus, they viewed gender-unequal practices within their religious cultures as an aberration from the essence of religion. In this way, they firmly rejected the dominant discourse that religion is inherently antithetical to gender equality.

On judgement day: Anorexic and obese women's phenomenological experience of the body, food and eating	FEMINISM & PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						anorexia; obesity; phenomenology; emotions; embodiment	FATNESS; DISORDERS; NERVOSA; BODIES; FAT; CONSTRUCTIONS; DISCOURSE; STIGMA; CARE	In contemporary Western society, both anorexic and obese(1) bodies are regarded to be out of bounds. Although scholars have enhanced our understanding of anorexia and obesity, these disorders have most often been studied in isolation from one another. In this article, we examine the similarities and differences in the embodied experiences of anorexic and obese women. Informed by the phenomenological research tradition, we follow in the footsteps of other scholars who have already begun to depart from binarized, polarized views by describing how women living with anorexia and obesity in two Canadian provinces experience the body, food and eating. Anorexic and obese women described a vast range of intense emotional experiences to characterize their relationship to food, the body and eating. Shame marked the bodies of these women. Family relationships also changed how the women experienced the body and food over time. The women ascribed a diverse array of complex meanings to the body and food. We hope that our study opens new phenomenological terrain to dialogue with and for anorexic and obese bodies in a relational way, recognizing that both of these bodies hurt in a remarkably similar manner. In a judgement day of sorts, both anorexic and obese bodies carry the heavy burden of culture's expectations to fit within a narrow range of normative slenderness.

Framed largely as a biological or normative behavioral sexual function issue and not as a subjective experience, no previous qualitative studies have asked women to discuss their feelings about their vaginal lubrication and wetness. This study analyzed semi-structured interviews with 20 women from a diverse 2014 community sample collected in a large Southwestern U.S. city in order to examine American women's subjective feelings about their own vaginal lubrication and wetness, particularly the sensations they experience and the meanings they make around wetness. Results revealed four themes in how women described vaginal lubrication: (1) wetness as pleasure, joy, and connection; (2) wetness as physical and biological phenomenon; (3) anxiety about insufficient wetness; and (4) having excessive or too much wetness. Tensions surrounding women's sexual anxieties and where they place responsibility for too little wetness is discussed in tandem with analyses of how pleasure and arousal may (or may not) overlap with feelings about sexual normality and health. Ultimately, renewed attention to the complexities of women's sexual arousal and function, particularly in stark contrast with pharmaceutical efforts to medicate women's sexual arousal and reduce it to brain chemistry, are examined.

However, the role of cultural discourse in shaping women's construction and embodied experience of sexuality has received less attention. In this study, we examined heterosexual women's constructions of sexual embodiment in the context of cancer. Sixteen women across a range of ages (20-71 years), cancer types and stages took part in in-depth semi-structured interviews. A thematic decomposition analysis was conducted on the interview transcripts, drawing on feminist poststructuralist theory. A main theme was identified in which the women took up subject positions of Embodying sexuality and Embodying the absence of sexuality. Accounts of Embodying sexuality included Experiencing bodily ease during sex and Managing a dysfunctional body during sex. The women's positioning of Embodying the absence of sexuality included Asexuality and the absence of desire and Unsuccessful attempts to renegotiate sex. Women's intrapsychic negotiation of sexual and gendered discourse, the materiality of embodied change and relationship context influenced their constructions of sexual subjectivity. These findings indicate a need for researchers and clinicians to acknowledge cultural discourses of sex and gender that shape the possibilities and constraints for women's sexual well-being after cancer.

J	Li, AY; Braun, V				Li, Alex Yang; Braun, Virginia			Pubic hair and its removal: A practice beyond the personal	FEMINISM & PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						pubic hair removal; femininity; hairlessness; queer women; gendered bodies	WOMENS BODY HAIR; WHITE WOMEN; UNITED-STATES; YOUNG-WOMEN; MEN; SELF; GENDER; HEALTH; SEX; PERCEPTIONS	Pubic hair removal, now common among women in Anglo/western cultures, has been theorised as a disciplinary practice. As many other feminine bodily practices, it is characterised by removal or alteration of aspects of women's material body (i.e., pubic hair) considered unattractive but otherwise natural. Emerging against this theorisation is a discourse of personal agency and choice, wherein women assert autonomy and self-mastery of their own bodies and body practices. In this paper, we use a thematic analysis to examine the interview talk about pubic hair from 11 sexually and ethnically diverse young women in New Zealand. One overarching theme - pubic hair is undesirable; its removal is desirable - encapsulates four themes we discuss in depth, which illustrate the personal, interpersonal and sociocultural influences intersecting the practice: (a) pubic hair removal is a personal choice; (b) media promote pubic hair removal; (c) friends and family influence pubic hair removal; and (d) the (imagined) intimate influences pubic hair removal. Despite minor variations among queer women, a perceived norm of genital hairlessness was compelling among the participants. Despite the articulated freedom to practise pubic hair removal, any freedom from participating in this practice appeared limited, rendering the suggestion that it is just a choice problematic.

The concern with differences includes the socially constructed categories sex and gender, as well as sexuality and social class. Those articles addressing the biological represent critical scholarship that is working to negotiate a place for the biology within feminist psychology and entails moving away from the view that the biological is natural and innate. This introductory article addresses how theory fits within feminist psychology and offers a brief history of debates concerning differences and the biological before offering summaries and observations related to each selected article.

While there is a robust body of feminist research into the gendered discourses framing child sexual abuse, domestic violence, and rape and sexual assault, there has been little feminist examination of CEA. This article reports on the findings from two interview studies with women who have backgrounds of CEA exploring how this form of abuse is constituted through gendered discourses, practices, and power relations. The studies were framed by McNay's theoretical concept of situated intersubjectivity, which attends to both the discursive and material bases of gender oppression. Discourse analysis was used to examine the gender discourses and practices in women's narratives of CEA. Based on the analysis of the interviews, CEA is theorized as a gender practice that is often concerned with imposing a traditional femininity on daughters, but it is also shown to encapsulate contradictions about contemporary femininities where rights to autonomy and independence sit in some tension with traditional expectations. The article adds to feminist theorization by considering how the gender discourses and practices constituting CEA and other forms of violence against women intertwine with structural gender power relations and considers the implications of these insights for social work practice.

Victim Motivations for Disclosing Unwanted Sexual Experiences and Partner Abuse	AFFILIA-JOURNAL OF WOMEN AND SOCIAL WORK			English	Article						domestic violence; gender-based violence; intimate partner violence; sexual abuse	DATING VIOLENCE; WOMENS EXPERIENCES; ASSAULT SURVIVORS; COLLEGE-WOMEN; HELP-SEEKING; RAPE; JUSTICE; GENDER; CAMPUS; RACE	Sexual assault and partner abuse are major problems on college campuses. While the majority of victims will tell a friend or other informal support about their experience, formal disclosures to authorities are still infrequent. Past research has examined barriers to choosing to disclose; however, little research has explored victims' motivational goals behind their decision to disclose to various people. In the present study, 13 semistructured interviews were conducted with survivors of partner abuse and/or sexual violence at northeastern universities in the United States and the resulting data were content coded for motivations associated with disclosing. Four major themes emerged: (1) improving emotional or psychological well-being; (2) fulfilling perceived social obligations or responsibilities; (3) seeking information or assessment; and (4) seeking action in the form of advocacy, accommodations, or criminal prosecution. Results from this study suggest that there is not a one-size-fits-all model for responding to informal and formal reports of victimization on campuses. Implications of these results for designing survivor-centered college community responses will be discussed.

The research performed in the region of Antofagasta, Chile, is based on an interpretive paradigm, with discursive analysis. Twenty-eight people were interviewed based on the category of conflicts and tensions in money negotiations. Findings include that among older women and men, money appears to be masculinized and associated with an illusion of empowerment of women, exacerbating the androcentric sex/gender model. In their discourses, some women express their progress toward relationships of greater equity. Couples must deal with gender conflicts when negotiating money. Even though women manage the family's money, it's not considered their money; therefore, they don't feel free to use it and must account to the man. In this power game and in negotiating, the model of romantic love prevails, the couple's public and private position, and a neoliberal culture that promotes high levels of consumption.

Drawing on in-depth interviews with 17 Australian men who had perpetrated domestic violence, this article reports their accounts of using this tactic. This tactic was found to be particularly pernicious and grounded in hegemonic representations of the good mother. Domestically violent men deployed this tactic instrumentally to exert power and control over women and children.

I reveal that employment is subjectively policed by state agents and must meet three conditions to count as work: reliable, recognizable, and redemptive. I find that women who are unable to meet these employment conditions are framed by state agents as failing to demonstrate an appropriate commitment to their moraland therefore criminalrehabilitation, and consequently experience perceived threats of reincarceration. Building a theory of intersectional capitalism, I argue that rehabilitation labor is situated within a broader historical project of making black women legible to the state through the labor market.

Taking an intersectional approach to the analysis of attorneys' strategies during child sexual assault trials, this article argues that legal narratives draw on existing gender, racial, and age stereotypes to present legally compelling evidence of credibility. This work builds on Crenshaw's focus on women of color, emphasizing the role of structures of power and inequality in constituting the conditions of children's experiences of adjudication. Using ethnographic observations of courtroom jury trials, transcripts, and court records, three narrative themes of child credibility emerged: invisible wounds, rebellious adolescents, and dysfunctional families. Findings show how attorneys use these themes to emphasize the child's unmarked body, imperceptible emotional responses, rebellious character, and harmful familial environments. The current study fills a gap in sexual assault research by moving beyond trial outcomes to address cultural narratives within the court that are inextricably embedded in intersectional dimensions of power and the reproduction of social status.

My findings illustrate how nursing's historically subordinate position as a female profession has led to institutional arrangements and aspirational resources for contemporary careers. Features such as flexible educational institutions and an extended credentials ladder allow women to recast structural constraints into individual possibilities. This recasting allows individuals to make careers but also recirculates notions of flexible women whose careers are institutionalized as secondary to family concerns.

J	Peretz, T				Peretz, Tal			Engaging Diverse Men: An Intersectional Analysis of Men's Pathways to Antiviolence Activism	GENDER & SOCIETY			English	Article						masculinities; intersectionality; violence against women; allies	VIOLENCE; WOMEN	Despite the demonstrated utility of intersectionality, research on men allied with women's rights movements has largely focused on white, heterosexual, middle-class, young men. This study illustrates the importance of attending to men's intersecting identities by evaluating the applicability of existing knowledge about men's engagement pathways to the predominantly African American members of a Muslim men's anti-domestic violence group and a gay/queer men's gender justice group. Findings from a year-long qualitative study highlight how these men's experiences differ from those in the literature. While the Muslim men's experiences add dimension to the existing knowledgeespecially regarding age and parenthood, online interactions, and formal learning opportunitiesthe gay/queer men's experiences are not accurately represented within it. Their pathways begin earlier, do not rely on women's input, do not create a shift in gendered worldview, and lack a pathway narrative because they connect to gender justice through their own intersecting identities and experiences. This suggests that a marginalized identity is not in itself sufficient to alter engagement pathways; the particular type of marginalization matters.

However, the popularisation of feminist discourses in digital media has not brought substantial political change. In this article, I demonstrate how famous working mothers like Sandberg and Tina Fey provide accounts of their difficulties with identifying as women who have it all', although they are often perceived in such terms. I propose the framework of affective dissonance to describe the discrepancy between their own sense of self and the public perception of them as women who have it all'. I argue that both Sandberg and Fey fail to contribute to a renewed political feminism because they disavow their experience of affective dissonance, rather than actualising its political potential. These women who have it all' are entrenched in postfeminist neoliberal discourses of choice and agency, which locks them in frameworks of identity politics, foreclosing the possibility of an ethics of solidarity necessary for a feminist movement that might produce political transformation.

Relational work and embodied responsibility in altruistic surrogate motherhood	FEMINIST THEORY			English	Article						Altruism; embodied labour; hospitality; relational work; responsibility; surrogate motherhood	TRANSNATIONAL COMMERCIAL SURROGACY; ETHICS; MONEY; WOMEN	Studies on surrogate motherhood have mostly explored paid arrangements through the lens of a contract model, as clinical work or as a maternal identity-building project. Turning to the under-examined case of unpaid, so-called altruistic surrogate motherhood and based on an analysis of interviews with women who had been unpaid surrogate mothers in a full gestational surrogacy with a friend or relative in Canada, the United States or Australia, this article explores altruistic surrogate motherhood as relational work. It argues that this form of surrogate motherhood within close interpersonal relations can be conceptualised through the relational work involved in hosting a child for the intended parents. The article explores how relational work in this context implies an embodied, asymmetrical and far-reaching sense of responsibility that surrogate mothers describe as characteristic of their surrogacy experience. In this way, the article sheds light on feminist concerns about surrogacy as an embodied and objectifying work of women while at the same time illuminating how surrogate mothers respond to the intended parents in light of their pre-surrogacy relationship, how meanings are negotiated by them and how relationships are managed during the pregnancy.

J	Conway, JM				Conway, Janet M.			Troubling transnational feminism(s): Theorising activist praxis	FEMINIST THEORY			English	Article						Transnational feminism; transnational feminist activism; transnational feminist networks; World March of Women	WORLD MARCH; GLOBALIZATION; SOLIDARITIES; WOMEN	This article identifies a misfit between transnational feminist networks observed at the World Social Forum and the extant scholarship on transnational feminism. The conceptual divide is posited as one between transnational feminism understood, on the one hand, as a normative discourse involving a particular analytic and methodological approach in feminist knowledge production and, on the other, as an empirical referent to feminist cross-border organising. The author proposes that the US-based and Anglophone character of the scholarship, its post-structuralist and post-colonial genealogies and the transnational paradigm's displacement of area studies can be seen as contributing to the misfit. The article concludes by arguing for theoretical reconsideration of activist practice, place and the posts' - post-structuralism and post-colonialism - in the study of contemporary transnational feminist activisms. This marks an effort to get beyond the binary framework of transnational feminism' versus global sisterhood' in analysing activist practices within an increasingly diverse and complex transnational feminist field.

The current study examined associations between type of rape and mental and sexual health symptoms in 865 community women. All penetration types were positively associated with negative mental and sexual health symptoms. Oral and/or anal rape accounted for additional variance in anxiety, depression, some trauma-related symptoms, and dysfunctional sexual behavior than the association with vaginal rape alone. Findings suggest that penetration type can be an important facet of a rape experience and may be useful to assess in research and clinical settings.

Rape and Mental Health Outcomes Among Women: Examining the Moderating Effects of "Healthy" Fear Levels	VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN			English	Article						rape; fear; mental health	SEXUAL ASSAULT SURVIVORS; PTSD SYMPTOM SEVERITY; SELF-BLAME; SOCIAL REACTIONS; COLLEGE-WOMEN; CRIME; VICTIMIZATION; DISCLOSURE; ATTRIBUTIONS; PERCEPTIONS	This study examined the mediating and moderating impact of fear of victimization on the relationships between forcible and vicarious rape on depression and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among college women. Forcible and vicarious rape positively affected PTSD and depression symptomology, but fear did not mediate these relationships. Fear moderated the impact of forcible rape on PTSD, but was not a moderator for depression. Findings suggest that there may be healthy levels of fear in the aftermath of victimization where having too little fear may leave women unnecessarily vulnerable to victimization, while having too much fear may lead to social isolation and withdrawal.

Bivariate analyses indicated Asian students scored significantly higher than Europeans on dominance, hostility to women, jealousy, negative attribution, and violence approval as well as perpetration of severe physical assault in dating relationships. Logistic regression models demonstrated that dominance and violence approval were significant predictors of severe physical and psychological aggression against dating partners. Implications for culturally relevant programming for intimate partner violence prevention are discussed.

Findings from a recent survey in rural Bangladesh suggest that empowerment is becoming protective even though IPV rates remain high. We construct qualitative case studies exploring factors and social processes underlying relationships between empowerment and IPV in four villages. Empowerment may be protective against IPV in the aggregate, but this relationship can be subverted at the micro level. Interventions are needed to reinforce the potential of empowerment to reduce IPV and counteract factors such as geographic isolation and limited employment opportunities that inhibit empowerment.

Interviews with 14 victim advocates and sexual assault prevention specialists were analyzed qualitatively using thematic analysis techniques. Participants described an increased focus on compliance as a means of managing the liability risks associated with inadequate policy implementation. These shifts toward compliance not only increased the motivation to accomplish reform but also limited those reforms by narrowing the focus. Participants described how narrow compliance resulted in decisions that may actually harm victims. Suggestions for improving policy and the implementation process are discussed.

Moreover, firearms may be more common in homes where intimate partner abuse has occurred. The Violence Against Women Act of 1994 banned possession of firearms by individuals subject to civil protection orders. Yet little research has focused on how this ban is communicated to survivors and batterers. Drawing on systematic observations of protection order hearings, the current study explores factors related to judicial discussion of the ban in court. Implications for improving protection orders and for increasing battered women's safety are discussed.

J	de Almeida, M				de Almeida, Marcia			A PECULIAR REPRESENTATION OF THE FEMALE BODY IN THE SOMALI DIASPORA	REVISTA ARTEMIS			Portuguese	Article						Postcolonial Literature; Somali diaspora; Female body		The attribution of stereotyped identities has been a limiting element for women and cultures taken as "others", pushed into subaltern roles according to which individual identities, conflicts, questionings and changes were not considered. However, in respect to women writers coming from Italian ex-colonies in Africa such subjectivities prove to be very alive and changing, expressing themselves and producing some new literature, which crosses territorial and symbolic boundaries. Thus, this article, based on postcolonial and gender theories, proposes the critical reading of Madre piccola, a novel by the Italian Somali writer Cristina Ubax Ali Farah, focusing on peculiar representations of the female body, a body which denounces the colonial past, revealing the continuity of opressive relations until the present.

In my analysis, I use Shange's trope of the "methaphysical dilemma" to consider the intersections of gender, race, and sexuality in these writers' textual representations of black women's bodies. Writing against a historical legacy of colonialism and domination that defined black bodies as "primitive" or "unbridled" (bell hooks 1991), I argue that these works illustrate some of the artistic/literary strategies contemporary black women writers use to re-claim the power of voice/voicing as they depict black women's subjectivities as unfinished, complex, but self-fashioned creations.

MATERNAL BODY AND RESISTANCE IN BUTTERFLY BURNING BY YVONE VERA	REVISTA ARTEMIS			Portuguese	Article						Motherhood; Female body; African feminisms; Cultural studies; Agency; Resistance		The present article aims at analysing the representation of the character Phephelaphi, from the novel Butterfly Burning, by Zimbabwean writer Yvonne Vera (1965-2005), under the light of the feminist theorectical perspectives about the female body and motherhood. In order to do so, the debate between Western and African feminisms will be aligned so as to amplify the discussions about the subaltern body, (a term derived from Spivak, 1985) which, in the aforementioned work, clashes against the patriarchal and the excluding gendred system of Zimbabwe. Our main argument is that, by representing female characters as women who refuse the effacing and the cultural expectations imposed by the context in which they are inserted, Yvonne Vera problematizes the monolithic perception of motherhood as the only possible fate women in the African context aspire to, when she builds characters whose view, contrary to the social norm of total abnegation and happiness, represents an attempt to give them voice and agency.

Having taken the body as our category of analysis and feminist criticism as our theoretical foundation, the metholodoly consists in the analytical reading of selected poems which brings up evidences of the female body, eroticized or not, being eroticism a frequent theme in Colasanti's poetics. We read her poems as a way of disrupting with the interdiction posed on eroticism in respect to women and the taboos which often impregnate the perceptions on women's bodies. We conclude that the poet gives voice to various women's desire, women who seek for freedom in respect to their bodies e their lives in general terms.

The violent episode experienced by Hajinder brings up several social and cultural tensions in that family group, forcing that young woman to leave her community, making ends meet on her own in a big city. In this way, the body demarcates a conflictive social space, since it is a symbolic terrain explored in the power relations to classify and hierarchize groups and individuals, being also permeated by subjectivities. In this sense, our article discusses Asian-Canadian literary production and incorporates a diaspora experience of women in the in-between space.

ADICHIE	REVISTA ARTEMIS			Portuguese	Article						Diaspora; Body; Gendered body; Transnational experience; Race		Americanah (2014), third novel by Nigerian writer Chimamanda N. Adichie, presents the trajectory of two characters whose diasporic experiences shape a new self who comes about when the characters are back to their home country. In the narrative, we find nuances of the discussions on gender, currently present in the writing by Western women, as well as Eastern women, where questions about social expectations over women are raised. This work also encompasses sub-narratives in which the body is portrayed as a channel through which the subjects experience the diaspora. The body, gendered and racialized in the transnational experience, is a portal for characters to shape new subjectivities. In the present article, we focus on the protagonist Ifemelu and her exercise of writing about the diasporic experience, and we look at ways in which gender, body and race are presented in intersecting ways in the life of the protagonist and her writings on her blog. The visions and postures which emerge from these bodies experiencing the diaspora, introduce new ways in which to look at a developed nation: raising questions, presenting curiosity and a critical perception, elements which also form the subject who lives in the transnational space and returns home.

The qualitative methodology was based on fieldwork with participant observation and semi-structured interviews, about experiences and subjectivities, in a support group for transgender people in Barcelona. Zara, homosexual transgender woman, was elected to narrate her life story. It was discussed her experiences in all stages, added with the perceptions by the group and comparing them with other studies. It was seen that the transsexual phenomenon is an identity construction process painful, individual and continuous with several socioheteronormative barriers. It follows that the existence of transsexuals is precarious from childhood. However, know your most critical problems psychosociocultural enables a reflection on the new possibilities of being, acting and feeling the gender in the body.

Starting from the Gender Studies perspective, it seeks to evidence the questionings and ruptures of the domination practices at that time presented by the writer Andradina de Oliveira in her book O perdao (1910), an urban novel set in the Rio Grandense Belle Epoque. As a theoretical basis of this study, concepts from authors from different fields of knowledge, such as Beauvoir, Schmidt, Bourdieu, Perrot and Foucault, will be used, which will focus on the following points: the placement of women in society at different times, the male domination, the patriarchal society and the invisibility of women writers in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.

The tradition of the Carimbo is tributary of a cultural miscegenation that involved blacks, indigenous and Europeans, reflected in the details of dance, musical instruments and expressions of the body. It is in this expressive and discursive complexity, which also reveals itself in the nuances of everyday life, which sought images about women and their analysis from contemporary thoughts, including issues raised by feminist theories. Song lyrics and particularities about women involved in the manifestations of the Carimbo in Para/BR are presented.

For this, women's history is discussed, the image as a form of language, the emergence of the musical video and the career of Beyonce. The research methods used in this study are documentary and bibliographical, and the observation and analysis of the documentary " Beyonce: Life is but a Dream" and the video clip that is the object of study. Robles (2006) and Sarti (2004), for the types of feminism, Heywood (2010), Nye (1998), Nicholson (2010) and Garcia and Miranda (2012) are some of the theoretical basis of the study. In order to discuss the image as a language, Dondis (1997), Aumont (1993) and Deleuze (1983) are used. The analysis is based on the semiotics of Joly (1996) and Santaella (1983) with the help of Chevalier (1999), Mondro (2008) and Farina (2006). Through the image analysis of the video clips, it was possible to identify signs used by Beyonce to discuss feminism with the audience.

For this purpose, it was analyzed, through a process of historical regression based on Muraro (1993) and Tosi's (1998) studies, among others, how female exclusion from the above mentioned field has been occurring which is highlighted by means of several recurrent discourses and practices in our daily lives. Subsequently, by considering the importance of women participation and contribution in the field of Mathematics, a brief biographical reports on female mathematicians, who are kindly called brave transgressors in this work, are going to be presented. Thus, it also aims at provoking discussion on this matter in order to lead the reader to question the reason why there are few women in the branches of the exact sciences.

It is defined as a malevolent course of conduct involving fathers' use of custody and/or child protection proceedings to overturn historic patterns of care for children. The experience of custody stalking is explored through three composite narratives derived from twelve mothers who participated in an exploratory, qualitative study on the involuntary loss of maternal care time following separation. The losses suffered caused these mothers tremendous grief, damaged their psychological wellbeing and had a detrimental effect on their mothering relationships. Yet custody stalking, as a form of malevolent attack, is not well recognised and mothers' resultant losses are largely culturally invisible. This is in marked contrast to paternal filicides, another form of post-separation avenging attack committed by some fathers that also leads to maternal loss experiences, albeit more absolute.

In this article we advocate for a victim-centred justice response to street harassment, specifically examining the potential for transformative justice to function in this way. Drawing on data from a recent Australian study, we examine participants' understandings of justice and desired justice responses to street harassment. Participants' responses drew attention to a range of perceived shortcomings of the formal justice system as a mechanism for responding to street harassment. Instead, participants advocated for a justice response concerned with transforming cultural and structural norms, in particular gender norms. We end in an examination of the limitations of transformative justice, looking to recent work on "kaleidoscopic justice" as a way of transforming common conceptions of justice itself.

J	Cobb, N; Godden-Rasul, N				Cobb, Neil; Godden-Rasul, Nikki			Campus Feminisms A Conversation with Jess Lishak, Women's Officer, University of Manchester Students' Union, 2014-2016	FEMINIST LEGAL STUDIES			English	Editorial Material						Campus feminism; Student activism; Women's officers; Students' unions; Critical practice; Institutional strategies; Campaigning; Violence against women		Drawing from a long history of feminist writing grounded in personal reflection and informal dialogue between feminist thinkers, Cobb and Godden-Rasul present an email-based conversation with Jess Lishak, the outgoing Women's Officer at the University of Manchester Students' Union (2014-2016). The conversation draws on Cobb and Godden-Rasul's experience as feminist academics engaged in critical institutional practice through such initiatives as editing the Inherently Human blog, organising the Inspirational Women of Law exhibition, and participating in university working groups on campus-based harassment and violence. In asking Lishak to reflect on her journey to feminism and her experiences of activism, the conversation ranges over such issues as personal influences and experiences, strategies for securing institutional support, encouraging student engagement with feminism, and campaigning tactics. The conversation developed out of a "Campus Feminisms" event in March 2016, which explored the rise of exciting new grassroots single-issue campaigns and political mobilisations by students in higher education, and was organised by Cobb and Godden-Rasul at Newcastle University, UK. Undergraduate and postgraduate students shared their personal struggles and achievements in bringing feminist ideas and campaigns to their university campuses. Lucy Morgan, the Gender Equality Officer at Newcastle University Students' Union, offered inspiring reflections on her efforts to reinvigorate the 'F' word, in the face of simultaneous student apathy and backlash. Many of these campus-based mobilisations have demanded better institutional responses to sexual violence against women. At around the same time, Cobb was beginning a new role as the co-chair of the University of Manchester's first Task & Finish Group on Sexual Violence and Harassment on Campus. This followed Universities UK's decision to create a taskforce to consider options for improving institutional responses to student safety. In the process, Cobb crossed paths with Lishak, who had been appointed a member of the UUK Taskforce in light of her path-breaking students' union work addressing violence against women. Since Lishak was an exemplar of this new feminist wave in higher education, one that was still inadequately understood by feminist academics despite often working side-by-side within the same institutions, the authors embarked on this conversation in order to better understand the relationship between academic and student feminist activism on campus. As Lishak makes clear in her own reflections, there is nothing inevitable about the synergies between these movements, but there is potentially a great deal that could be achieved through their closer engagement.

The protagonist of the novel (and the rest of the trilogy) is Katniss Everdeen, a young woman who through an ethics of care, disruption of the heteronormative script, and a critical posthuman embodiment offers an alternative to the dystopic present offered by postfeminism. In Katniss' dystopian world, Collins constructs a narrative that highlights the continued need for a feminist politics of engagement and activism that works against claims for neo-liberal individualism.

J	Harrison, RV				Harrison, Rachel V.			dystopia as liberation: disturbing femininities in contemporary Thailand	FEMINIST REVIEW			English	Article						Thai cinema; Thai culture; Thai politics; horror films; monstrous-feminine; Yingluck Shinawatra; Kham Phaka		Despite the stereotypical, outsider view of Thailand as a thriving hub of international sex tourism, traditional and local constructions of Thainess instead privilege the position of the 'good' Thai woman-a model of sexual propriety, demure physicality and aesthetic perfection. This is the image of femininity that is heralded by Thailand's Tourist Authority and by government agencies alike as a marketable symbol of cultural refinement and national pride. But this disturbing 'utopian' construction of femininity might for some be considered a dystopia shaped by forms of power centred on elite urban rule. In mainstream definitions of Thainess, the monstrous and grotesque inverses of 'good' womanhood are located in the 'dystopian' visions of rural-based folk traditions that abound with malevolent female spirits and demons, and in the contemporary Thai horror films that draw on these tropes. Adopted by Thai feminists and by street protestors in Bangkok at times of recent political unrest, portrayals of a 'monstrous-feminine' have been adopted as central to a carnivalesque strategy of response and resistance to elite discourses of control. Such forces serve to symbolically disturb and destabilise middle-class constructions of a utopian vision of Thainess with Bangkok as its cultural core. This paper examines instances of how and why the counter-strategy of primitivism and monstrosity has developed, and the extent to which it translates 'dystopian' expressions of female sexuality in new imaginaries of 'dystopia' as a space of liberation from stultifying cultural and political norms.									64	1	1	3	4	PALGRAVE MACMILLAN LTD	BASINGSTOKE	BRUNEL RD BLDG, HOUNDMILLS, BASINGSTOKE RG21 6XS, HANTS, ENGLAND	0141-7789	1466-4380		FEMINIST REV	Fem.

J	Snaith, H				Snaith, Helen			dystopia, gerontology and the writing of Margaret Atwood	FEMINIST REVIEW			English	Article						dystopia; ageing; cyberspace; spatiality; sexuality; contemporary writing		Old age and visions of the future are inherently bound with one another, and the realms of dystopian fiction provide scope for a gerontological focus within contemporary literature. A theme that is now being revisited in speculative fiction, this paper aims to assess the role of the elderly within Margaret Atwood's dystopian tales, specifically looking at the role of gerontology in her collection of short stories Stone Mattress: Nine Wicked Tales (2014). I argue that Atwood utilises the dystopian narrative in order to address broader social issues that stem from immobility and declining virility. Focussing on Atwood's feminist politics and representations of the elderly woman in the dystopian narrative, this paper proposes that older women in Atwood's fiction seek to move beyond the asexual, immobile and matronly gerontological stereotype that is often portrayed in literature. Instead, the elderly, and in particular elder women, adapt to their environment, often becoming figures of their community. They are aware of sexual desires and look to move within and beyond societal constraints, utilising the realms of cyberspace in order to forge their own identity. The role of the elderly in a distinctly dystopian narrative allows for a new utopian strategy to be constructed.

Soldiers and migrant workers were understood to be the main vectors of syphilis beginning in the mid-nineteenth century. Efforts to control the disease were complicated by a lack of effective treatment until the 1910s, inadequate investment in health care, disparate agendas at the provincial and imperial level, and resistance to treatment by men who feared loss of status and jobs. Transmission intensified during World War I. By the war's end attempts to regulate and cultivate syphilitic men aligned with the loss of Ottoman control over territory and population and new anxieties concerned with establishing a new state built on "proper" healthy marital reproduction. Sources examined include regulations, medical advice literature, and encounters between syphilitic men and medical authorities captured in archival sources.

J	Abdo, D				Abdo, Diya			Go Underground, YoungWomen Writing Selves in Miral al-Tahawy's The Tent	JOURNAL OF MIDDLE EAST WOMENS STUDIES			English	Article						Miral al-Tahawy; al-Khiba' (The Tent); Arab women writers; autobiography; authorial double		Readings of the Egyptian writer Miral al-Tahawy's first novel, al-Khiba' (1996), typically view it as autobiographical, casting its first-person narrator Fatima as the author's oppressed double. Equally dismissive, nonautobiographical readings cast her as passive "madwoman." This article argues that an autobiographical reading attentive to Fatima's style, language, and technique reveals her to be al-Tahawy's dramatized interpretation of her writing self and its aspirational potential. The novel demands such a reading because of its overt modeling of autobiographical agential creation by Fatima, who creates her own authorial double, Zahwa. Neither submissive madwoman nor her creator's wretched double, Fatima adopts strategies that offer us a guide to the necessary (if risky) creative methods of the woman "desert writer." These methods rely on deep-diving into text and subtext (symbolized by Zahwa's underground world), where imagination and code can resist oppression, escape censoring, interrogate the sacred, excavate sources of power, subvert the normative, and evade Western co-optation.

The French metropolitan system of regulated prostitution was imported yet transformed in the mandate region as women performers were sorted into legitimate, if morally suspect, foreign artistes and autochthonous performers defined as prostitutes by decrees and codes. Regional and transnational mobility and the institutionalization of borders by colonial administrations destabilized their own distinctions between foreign and autochthonous, however. Women used these contradictions, overlapping legal frameworks, and artistry to continue to work and limit the extraction of their resources by a variety of institutional actors who nevertheless expected sexual and entertainment services to be afforded to foreign and local men.

Deviating from convention, this study considers the problem to be a function of macroeconomic factors. Empirical data were drawn from Cameroon. Multiple regression analyses involving natural logarithm and commensurate statistics were employed to analyze the data. Gender inequality, the dependent variable, was operationalized as the percentage of land titles issued to men minus the percentage issued to women. Two macroeconomic indicators, per capita gross domestic product (GDP) and per capita gross national income (GNI), comprised the predictor variables. A strong inverse relation between the dependent and predictor variables was hypothesized. Multiple tests validated all but one of the hypotheses. This revelation suggests that economic growth-promoting strategies can lead to the evaporation of gender-based gaps in access to land. The revelation is' consistent with neoclassical theories that consider economic development a viable tool for improving the status of women. A positive relation between per capita GNI and gender inequality, conflicting with the hypothesized link, was found. This implies a need to redistribute the fruits of development in order to, inter alia, narrow the gender-based discrepancies in access to land. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Utilizing Arab, Muslim and anti-racist feminist theories, I analyze a colonialist and Islamist patriarchal alliance built on two gendering and racializing logics. I refer to these overlapping logics as 'double hijabophobia.' Both FIFA and Muslim-majority nations used medicalized and cultural notions of the hijab, safety and dress laws. Double hijabophobia denies Muslim women players their bodily integrity and excludes them from world football. This analysis also recognizes Muslim women athletes who are working to overcome colonialist and Islamist racializing and gendering logics in sport. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Zubair, S; Zubair, M				Zubair, Shirin; Zubair, Maria			Situating Islamic feminism(s): Lived religion, negotiation of identity and assertion of third space by Muslim women in Pakistan	WOMENS STUDIES INTERNATIONAL FORUM			English	Article						Islam; Feminism; Pakistan; Postcolonial; Women; Identities	GENDER	This paper reports the findings of an exploratory, qualitative study with Pakistani women to explore how Muslim women studying English in higher education contexts in Pakistan engage with feminist thought. The broader aim of the study was to capture the relationship between these women's 'secular' education and their religious (and secular) social identities as young, urban, middle class working women in a Pakistani higher education context. In particular, the study sets out to explore how Pakistani women at higher education institutions interact with and use 'new' forms of knowledges, particularly those dominated by western frameworks of intellectual thought and reasoning, in the context of their own potentially different social lives and self-identities as Muslim women. The findings show that the young women academics in addition to negotiating with the Western notions of Feminism also simultaneously challenge the indigenous patriarchal hegemonies and conservative religious discourses in their social context by attempting to rework notions of Muslim women's identity in Pakistan, envisaging what Bhabha has termed a third space.

This research, however, seldom engages with philosophical issues relating to embodied subjectivity in order to explain and understand the trends noted. In this paper, we attempt to bridge the divide between feminist theory and current research on the menstruation-related challenges facing women today. We provide a feminist phenomenological account of menstruation in which women's shared bodily lived experiences of menstruation-the body as situation-are set within contexts that enable and/or restrain freedom the body in situation. This account allows us to understand the universal and differentiated aspects of menstruation and menstrual management, thereby providing a nuanced picture of the interplay between the physical occurrence of menstruation, the symbolic associations made with menstruation, and the socio-material, historical and political conditions within which women live. Such an account, we suggest, should inform advocacy around public policy and institutional civic society that promotes the freedom of women to engage in important life projects, and ground public health interventions around menstruation related challenges.

In the UK, electronic monitoring technology has been introduced to record (and materially reduce) the working time and wages of homecare workers. Based on empirical findings, we show that, in a 'time of austerity', care is reductively constructed as a consumption of time. Service users are constructed as needy, greedy, time-consumers and homecare workers as resource-wasting time-takers. We point to austerity as a temporal ideology aimed at persuading populations that individual deprivation in the present moment, self-sacrifice and the suppression of personal need in the here and now is a necessary requirement to underpin a more secure national future. Accordingly, women in low-waged care work are required to eschew a rights-bearing, present-tense identity and are assumed willing to suppress their entitlements to lawful wages as a sacrifice to the future. By transforming our understandings of 'care' into those of 'time consumption', and by emphasizing the virtue of present-tense deprivation, a politics of austerity appears to justify time-monitoring in care provision and the rationing of homecare workers' pay.

Boundaried Caring and Gendered Emotion Management in Hospice Work	GENDER WORK AND ORGANIZATION			English	Article						boundaries; feeling rules; emotions; health care; hospice; qualitative	GLASS ESCALATOR; CARE WORK; HEGEMONIC MASCULINITY; UNDOING GENDER; WOMENS WORK; MEN; LABOR; EXPERIENCES; FEMALE; ORGANIZATIONS	Caring work, which is premised on caring for and caring about recipients, involves a great deal of emotion management. Feeling rules shape expectations about emotion management and are informally shared through workers' narratives about quality work. Using qualitative data from hospice workers in the southwestern US, I find that narratives of quality within hospice include emotion-management skills such as listening, truly caring, keeping calm and maintaining boundaries. Through an analysis of how workers discuss and map skills onto individual women and men co-workers, this article highlights two gendered patterns. First, even when women and men are thought to share high-quality skills, the ways these skills are described reinforce naturalistic understandings of gender. Second, men are seen to hold a broad range of emotion-management skills, but women are not described as holding the most important emotion-management skill: keeping boundaries. Understanding this differential application of emotion-management skills helps us to understand how gender and gender inequality are reproduced within caring work.

Memory-work and semi-structured interviews explored the career experiences of long-term hotel workers, highlighting the extent to which gender, intersecting with age, ethnicity and class, shape individual career choices. The key contribution of this article is to suggest that in hotels, as in other employment sectors, the apparent 'level playing field' at career-entry point, where merit is presumed to regulate promotional opportunities, soon disappears as the workings of power and influence within the organizational context take hold: privileges and penalties intersect.

The paper will analyze the migrants' experiences using intersectionality theory as a framework. Drawing on Anthias's social relations framework, this research will contribute to the field by demonstrating how intersectionality theory can be operationalized to understand the complex lived experiences of disadvantaged groups. The research will reveal how being a new migrant in Australia, unfamiliar with local job search processes, complicates jobseeking. The paper will show how gender and family roles impact this process, especially when young families are involved. Both genders suffer downward occupational mobility, with men seeking any type of work to get by, and women gravitating towards insecure forms of employment, or exiting the labour force, in order to manage the family unit.

Framing the Faculty Gender Gap: A View from STEM Doctoral Students	GENDER WORK AND ORGANIZATION			English	Article						gender; higher education; inequality; culture; STEM	SOCIAL-MOVEMENTS; SCIENCE; WOMEN; ATTITUDES; CULTURE; CHOICE; FIELDS; CAREER; WORK	Drawing on 48 interviews with science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) doctoral students at a private research university in the United States (US), we examine how students make sense of the preponderance of men at the faculty level despite increasing gender parity among students. Students' primary explanatory frame, historical bias, suggests that the gender gap will disappear when enough women attain their doctorates (PhDs). Competing frames include innate and constructed gender difference and the perceived incompatibility between a woman's body clock and an academic tenure clock. We argue that the frames that students use to explain the gender gap shed light on the cultural context of STEM, which is characterized by a tension between the belief in a meritocratic system and the acknowledgement of structural inequality. We suggest that men and women's preference for explanations that preclude bias, in light of women students' own experiences with sexism in graduate school, contributes to the reproduction of inequality by rendering invisible structural barriers to gender equality.

However, there is growing evidence that precarity, competition and lack of regulation within these industries is exacerbating inequalities with respect to gender, race and class. With a focus on gender and sexual harassment among female workers, this study involved 32 in-depth interviews with women working in the Netherlands' creative industries. Data were analyzed using content analysis. Findings suggest that sexual harassment is prevalent, and many women considered it to be part of their occupational culture and career advancement. Four factors influenced this phenomenon: competition for work; industry culture; gendered power relations; and the importance of informal networks. Implications include the need for a climate of non-tolerance, sector-specific research and guidelines, sensitivity training and further work with unions and professional associations to provide worker protection strategies traditionally undertaken by organizations. The article concludes that effective sexual harassment prevention requires action at the individual, educational, sectoral and governmental levels, beginning with public conversations to convey the message that sexual harassment is never acceptable.

Yet evidence shows that women's careers in law stagnate with proportionally small numbers of women progressing up the hierarchy from law graduate to partner. In this study we investigated how gendering and class processes impact on women's career progression. A major contribution is that we explored the heterogeneous views held by women below and above the partnership line, in Auckland's top law firms. Drawing on Acker's gendering processes (1990, 2006a) plus the accumulation of appropriate capitals needed to progress, we analysed 52 interview accounts. The women lawyers themselves were divided on how gendering and class processes impact on their career progression. Women partners accepted the hierarchical employment model of law and were confident in their role and place. Women below the partner line, while frustrated by the personal and professional requirements for success, did not demonstrate agency for change. In concluding, we reflect on the potential for change in the profession.

Attitudes Toward Gender Roles Among Adolescents in 36 Countries	SEX ROLES			English	Article						Adolescents; Gender equality; Attitudes toward gender roles; Parental education; International civic and citizenship education study	SEX-ROLE ATTITUDES; MIDDLE CHILDHOOD; FEMINIST ATTITUDES; SEPARATE SPHERES; LABOR-FORCE; WOMEN; EQUALITY; MEN; DAUGHTERS; PATTERNS	In the present article, we look at attitudes toward gender roles among young women and men in 36 countries with different levels of societal gender inequality. By applying multilevel models to data from the International Civic and Citizenship Education Study 2009, the study contributes to our understanding of gender inequality by showing that (a) both young women and young men (in 8th grade; M-age = 14.39 years) display more gender-egalitarian attitudes in countries with higher levels of societal gender equality; (b) young women in all countries have more egalitarian attitudes toward gender roles than young men do, but (c) the gender gap in attitudes is more evident in more egalitarian contexts; and (d) a higher level of maternal education is associated with more gender-egalitarian attitudes among young women. In contrast, no statistically significant association emerges between maternal employment and young men's attitudes. Overall, the findings suggest that adolescents in different contexts are influenced by the dominant societal discourse on gender inequality, which they interiorize and display through their own attitudes toward gender roles. However, the findings also indicate that young women are more responsive to external cues than young men are. This result, coupled with the fact that young men in egalitarian contexts have not adopted gender-egalitarian attitudes to the same extent as young women, is concerning because it suggests a slowdown in the achievement of societal gender equality that is still far from being reached.

Did I Cross the Line?: Gender Differences in Adolescents' Anonymous Digital Self-Reports of Wrongdoing in an Online Anonymous Context	SEX ROLES			English	Article						Aggressive behavior; Adolescent development; Sex roles; Human sex differences; Sex education; Cheating; Bullying; Morality	ROMANTIC RELATIONSHIPS; INFIDELITY; FRIENDSHIP; ADULTHOOD; ATTITUDES; SCHOOLS; HEALTH; MATTER; ROLES; GIRLS	Young people spend substantial and increasing quantities of time communicating on and through digital platforms. Online contexts can be frontiers for communication and disclosure unbounded from offline life. The present study explores how U.S. teens position themselves in anonymous digital posts that pertain to wrongdoing. Do adolescents' posts reproduce social norms and popular gendered narratives about wrongdoing-or, conversely, do anonymous platforms allow for a departure from gendered scripts? The authors draw on 780 online stories (390 written by self-reported young men, 390 by self-reported young women) about teens' experiences with wrongdoing to investigate differences in reported rates of victimization and admission of wrongdoing between young male and female posters. Young men are more likely to report instances of their own wrongdoing than are young women, despite the fact that stories of victimization are equally likely to implicate young women and men as culpable of wrongdoing. These findings suggest adolescents internalize and express wrongdoing in gendered ways even in disembodied, anonymous online environments. For practitioners and policymakers interested in questions of school discipline, anti-bullying initiatives, and student accountability for interpersonal relationships, our findings suggest the need for the use of different scripts when setting context for male and female students.

The Importance of Social Belongingness and Self-Efficacy for Explaining Gender Differences in Interest in STEM and HEED Majors	SEX ROLES			English	Article						Gender; Interest; Belongingness; Self-efficacy; STEM; HEED	COGNITIVE CAREER THEORY; SEX-DIFFERENCES; CHOICE GOALS; WOMEN OPT; EXPECTATIONS; METAANALYSIS; MATHEMATICS; ROLES; MEN; ACHIEVEMENT	Throughout the world, the labor market is clearly gender segregated. More research is needed to explain women's lower interest in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) majors and particularly to explain men's lower interest in HEED (Health care, Elementary Education, and the Domestic spheres) majors. We tested self-efficacy (competence beliefs) and social belongingness expectations (fitting in socially) as mediators of gender differences in interest in STEM and HEED majors in a representative sample of 1327 Swedish high school students. Gender differences in interest in STEM majors strongly related to women's lower self-efficacy for STEM careers and, to a lesser degree, to women's lower social belongingness expectations with students in STEM majors. Social belongingness expectations also partly explained men's lower interest in HEED majors, but self-efficacy was not an important mediator of gender differences in interest in HEED. These results imply that interventions designed to lessen gender segregation in the labor market need to focus more on the social belongingness of students in the gender minority. Further, to specifically increase women's interest in STEM majors, we need to counteract gender stereotypical competence beliefs and assure women that they have what it takes to handle STEM careers.

Our study contributes to the growing body of research examining which narratives about gender segregation in male-dominated occupations are more or less oppressive to women. We asked 13 female and 9 male U.S. funeral directors to account for the shifting gender composition of their field. Most funeral directors explained women's entry into funeral directing and justified gender segregation in the occupation by drawing on gender beliefs about women's superior nurturing "natures" and men's "innate" superior physical strength and scientific ability. Our findings demonstrate the strength of cultural gender beliefs for shaping narratives about gender and work and suggest ways individuals grapple in their everyday interactions with "degendering" skills in feminizing occupations.

Using a social constructionist framework, we analyzed 48 Australian men's written accounts in response to an anonymous online questionnaire which explored messages they received about menstruation growing up as well as their current attitudes towards, and experiences with, menstruation. Respondents were 18-69 years-old; most were Caucasian and in an intimate relationship, and they varied considerably in terms of educational attainment. Thematic analysis yielded four themes: (a) managing the stigma of menstruation, (b) talking menstruation today-open and closed communication, (c) menstruation is part of relationships, and (d) menstruation and social commentary. These findings shed light on how boys learn about menstruation and how men's role in menstruation is constructed, emphasizing the educational, relational, and socio-political contexts in which these attitudes are created. Researchers, health care providers, and educators could use our findings to create more effective reproductive health education programs. Improving communication between parents and children may encourage a more balanced view towards menstruation, working towards reducing the stigma commonly experienced by girls and women.

Specifically, we determined the impacts of sexism on sexual self-label identification and requirements for a romantic partner's sexual role among 507 Chinese gay and bisexual men. Sexism was found to significantly predict top/bottom sexual self-label: gay and bisexual men endorsing benevolent sexism (BS; ideation of women who conform to traditional gender roles) were more likely to identify as tops than as bottoms. We also noted a significant prediction of hostile sexism (HS; hostility toward women who oppose traditional roles) on partner choice: Tops and bottoms endorsing HS were more likely to require a complementary partner rather than to have no requirements. Moreover, sexism was related to sexual role prejudice, a concept derived from sexism that we defined as holding attitudes toward the gender roles of "bottoms" among gay and bisexual men that indicate inequality of sexual self-labels. In a mediation analysis of these relationships, we noted significant indirect effects of BS and HS on sexual self-label via both benevolent and hostile sexual role prejudice, as well as on requirements for a romantic partner's sexual role via benevolent (but not hostile) sexual role prejudice. Our results suggest that traditional gender beliefs may influence negative beliefs toward other sexual roles and that both sets of beliefs, although not always consistent with each other, relate to gay and bisexual men's sexual self-labels and requirements for a romantic partner's sexual role.

In-depth interviews with 12 university women highlighted that physical violence need not be present for SC to be harmful, as many experienced guilt, anger, sadness, and self-blame. The severity of SC and the context of women's relationships affected their interpretations, which in turn affected the effects of SC. Many women not only held negative interpretations of their partners' SC but also minimized and justified. Thus, the interviews were also critically analyzed for the possible influence of dominant discourses and gendered power relations.

It gives voice to the realities of sexual assaults committed by ordinary White men who systematically terrorized African American families with impunity after the post-Reconstruction south until the 1960s. The interviewees discuss the short- and long-term impact of physical, mental, emotional, and sexual assaults in their communities. We discuss the top four prevalent themes that emerged related to sexual assault, specifically (a) the normalization of sexual assaults, (b) protective measures to avoid White violence, (c) the morality of African American women, and (d) the long-term consequences of assaults on children.

Experiment 2 further demonstrated that the relationship between hostile sexism and rape proclivity in response to a moderately violent rape scenario after exposure to sexist humor generalizes beyond women in the immediate humor context to women as a whole.

J	Ganesh, L				Ganesh, Lena			Gendered Mobility: Travel as a Rite of Passage	INDIAN JOURNAL OF GENDER STUDIES			English	Article						Gender; physical mobility; Gujarat; travel; videography by women	SAFETY	This article looks at aspects of gendered spatial access and appropriation to understand how spatial dynamics and mobility can be comprehended from a study of and observations on the life experiences of women videographers of VideoSEWA in Ahmedabad, India. The roaming subject, socially defined by class, caste, age and other factors is equally a socially located person who is a traveller. Using the concepts of separation, liminality and re-assimilation (Turner, 1967) through the prism of heterotopic space (Foucault, 1967), this article interrogates the widening of women's local spaces to translocal ones, their increased radii of mobility, the transference of spatial experiences to the local spheres and the contribution of all of these to the making of physical spatial claims by women. It highlights the importance of an intersectional analysis for understanding relationships between gender, space, mobility and resistance.			lganesh1@yahoo.in						53	0	0	0	1	SAGE PUBLICATIONS INDIA  PVT LTD	NEW DELHI	B-1-I-1 MOHAN CO-OPERATIVE INDUSTRIAL AREA, MATHURA RD, POST BAG NO 7, NEW DELHI 110 044, INDIA	0971-5215	0973-0672		INDIAN J GEND STUD	Indian J.

It attempts to revisit the assumptions regarding parenthood/reproduction from the perspectives of the Hindu family, society and the state. Despite the changes ushered in by industrialisation and a rapidly globalising economy, children in the Indian context (especially sons) are still considered a source of social security, ensuring the continuity of the family, caste, lineage and even of social prestige. Increasingly, modern medicine is a willing ally in playing with women's bodies to confer parenthood. Further, the paper questions the legal requirements laid down by the Indian state prescribing certain procedures, whereby parenthood is conferred on individuals through adoption. This paper argues that there exists a dialectical relationship between culture, medical technology and the state machinery to complicate the experience of parenthood.

Drama of the Early 20th Century, the Kerala Reform Movement and Namboodiri Women	INDIAN JOURNAL OF GENDER STUDIES			English	Article						Culture; hegemony; Namboodiri reform; Yogakshema Sabha; tradition; women's empowerment		With the stage always associated with social reform and collective commitment, drama played an active role in the early-20th-century Kerala reform movement. These plays of the 1920s and the 1930s emphasised the need for reforming the situation of women. Produced as a part of social renovation, they had a strong ideology that stood in favour of gender equity and initiated a cross-fertilisation of theatre literature and social restructuring. This paper locates the impact of drama in 20th-century Kerala on the portrayal of Namboodiri women and purports to analyse the deconstructing waves that lashed through the medium of theatre against the conventional norms of feminine subjugation. In this regard, the study explores the role of selected plays by V. T. Bhattathiripad, M. R. Bhattathiripad, Premji and Lalithambika Anterjanam as critical tools in the social reformation.

I argue here that these writers engage the graphic form to visualise female embodiment as always already pathologised, even prior to the onset of illness. By making explicit the medical and socio-cultural scrutiny of female bodily practices, these texts interrogate the unequal structural relationship between the sign of gender female and the healthy/sick binary set up by mainstream illness narratives. This article also proposes that these graphic memoirs of illness by women perform a resistant femininity in narrative by refusing a linear progression from diagnosis to cure. The texts instead make visible their myriad sources, in the form of incoherent speech, unedited data, photographs and letters among others, thus refusing unity and coherence in the narrating self.

Rethinking Panel Culture: Resistance and Subversion in Drawing the Line: Indian Women Fight Back	INDIAN JOURNAL OF GENDER STUDIES			English	Article						Gender; sexuality; identity; power; performativity; space		This paper sets out to interrogate an interesting dimension of a popular formthe graphic noveland its use as a mode of social activism. Illustrating clearly the myriad manifestations of sexuality in modern Indian urban spaces through 14 graphic narratives, Drawing the Line: Indian Women Fight Back (2015) is a bold attempt by Priya Kuriyan, Larissa Bertonasco and Ludmilla Bartscht in documenting the predicament of young women in our society in a rather refreshing manner. I focus on the performative aspect of gender by analysing the graphic texts where an effort is made to subvert the power structure by appealing to social conscience. Here, the authors have tried to rethink femininity in the contemporary Indian context by developing a counter-hegemonic narrative which challenges the aggressive nature of dominant masculinity and by opening up the possibility of constructing a counter-space' (Lefebvre). Intersection between verbal and visual representation in the graphic stories is studied with theoretical inputs from W. J. T. Mitchell, Michel Foucault and Judith Butler.

Women and Political Participation in India, Indonesia, Thailand, and Vietnam: A Preliminary Analysis of the Local Impact of Transnational Advocacy Networks in Climate Change Adaptation	ASIAN WOMEN			English	Article						women; local communities; climate change adaptation; political participation; transnational advocacy networks; India; Indonesia; Thailand; Vietnam; empowerment	GENDER	Our study examines the various ways transnational advocacy networks (TANs) may impact the ability of women to increase their social standing in local communities in India, Indonesia, Thailand, and Vietnam through climate change adaptation (CCA) programs. We analyze programs in each of the four nations and interview data from non-governmental organizers, local journalists, a social entrepreneur in India, one program manager who worked both in Vietnam and Thailand, and one strategic planner. While the programs we examine in this study are relatively new, and thus their long-term effects are as yet unknowable, our preliminary findings indicate that through technology and innovation, practical skills enhancements, and connections with local non- governmental organizations (NGO)-centered CCA projects, women have the potential to increase their political involvement and social status within their communities. While these experiences should provide women with more skills to enhance their social status, multiple structural factors in the regions on which we focused may impede women's political participation. We find that work-around strategies introduced in CCA programs may enable women to achieve greater autonomy. Correspondingly, NGO programs and interventions should be more successful when the state officially acknowledges gender equality and women's rights.

The research findings indicated that female entrepreneurs' personal traits, such as their educational attainments, professional skills, and economic status, had significantly positive impacts on their political participation, and that the division of labor within households was no longer a constraint to female entrepreneurs' political participation. Huge gaps were identified between what women entrepreneurs understood and perceived, and what motivated their political participation. Female entrepreneurs' families had neither encouraging nor discouraging attitudes toward their political participation. Organizations, however, played fundamental roles in facilitating and arranging for female entrepreneurs' political participation. Most female entrepreneurs' political participation was more characteristic of an organizational arrangement, while improving business performance and advancing their own interests were female entrepreneurs' real concerns for becoming politically engaged.

A growing body of comparative research on women's substantive representation provides insights into the kinds of policy topics that are often categorized as women's issues, as well as the personal backgrounds of the legislators who represent women's interests. We raise and analyze three key questions: Can only female legislators represent women's interests? How does a legislator's sex/gender interact with other factors such as partisanship in shaping who represents women's interests and how? How do contextual factors such as party systems impact how women's substantive representation occurs? We explore these questions in the context of the Tokyo Metropolitan Assembly and the Seoul Metropolitan Council using an in-depth examination of statements made by local council members in plenary and committee sessions (Tokyo 2009-2015 and Seoul 2009-2014). We found that similar issues are discussed as being relevant to women in the two local councils. However, the issues emphasized and where those issues are discussed vary across our cases. Female members, regardless of their party affiliation, address women's issues more often than their male counterparts in both countries, although female members of progressive parties tend to advocate for women more actively, and parties representing distinct constituencies and ideologies highlight different aspects of women's concerns. Our findings contribute to existing knowledge of women's substantive representation, as well as to research on women and politics in the Asian region.

While there is a broad consensus in the literature that proportional-representational electoral systems create fewer obstacles to women's representation, we are at a loss to explain how Japan's mixed system affects the election of women to its Lower House. To the extent that this mixed system combines attributes of both single-member district (SMD) and proportional-representation (PR) tiers, the impact of the mixed system on women's representation is contingent on how the system works. The key to understanding this mechanism, we contend, lies in political parties' nomination strategies. We therefore seek to understand whether and/or how the mechanisms of Japan's electoral system operate to elect women. In this study, we highlight three components of a political party's election strategy, 1) the allocation of candidates to different types of candidacy, 2) district assignments for SMD candidates, and 3) the placement of candidates on a PR election list. By analyzing six Lower House elections, which took place between 1996 and 2012, we find that the parties' efforts to strategically coordinate these three components has an impact on the number of women elected to Japan's Lower House. We also reveal that a high-ranking placement for a female candidate on a closed party list does not necessarily guarantee that she will win a PR seat, because the intertwined nature of the SMD and PR tiers makes outcomes in the SMD tier a prerequisite for winning in the PR tier.

We study twenty-eight European countries, including Central and Eastern European countries. We show that unless the leave period is exceptionally long, enhanced childcare and leave policies help women combine family responsibilities with paid work. The positive effect of leaves is, however, much weaker in countries where childcare is limited. In these countries, improving access to childcare is therefore a more efficient policy than offering extended leaves. Because extended leaves encourage women to stay outside of the labor market, they are found to lead to wage penalties.

This article considers the relationship between notions of beauty, fatness, black womanhood, and the physical culture movement a white-led fitness campaign that took place between 1900 and the 1930s. It argues that middle-class black women used physical culture to promote their ideals of beauty and the slender black female body at a time when thinness held new civic and political meaning. From the turn of the twentieth century, middle-class blacks began to reject fatness and encourage black women to slim down, beautify, and enhance their bodies through purposeful exercise. By examining this discussion of black anti-fat bias, this article seeks to challenge assumptions about black women's ideas of beauty, fat acceptance, and their relationship to weight.

J	Klann, M				Klann, Mary			BABIES IN BASKETS: Motherhood, Tourism, and American Identity in Indian Baby Shows, 1916-1949	JOURNAL OF WOMENS HISTORY			English	Article								This article explores Indian baby shows, contests that evaluated babies on standards of ideal health, in both the Progressive Era and the years surrounding WWII. In comparison to non-Native shows, Native baby shows took on added significance. In particular, shows for tourists at Yosemite National Park (1916-1929) were charged with racialized ideologies that vacillated between goals of assimilation and the promotional lure of exoticization. Shows conducted during the 1940s at "Nevada Day" celebrations similarly fetishized Native women and children because of their perceived cultural differences, but simultaneously characterized them as "All-American." The reoccurrence of baby shows in these distinct contexts highlights the evolution of Americanization in the lives of Native women and children throughout the twentieth century. Although the particular touristic and symbolic goals of baby shows changed over time, Native women's consistent interaction with the state and the public demonstrates their powerful engagement with conceptions of American identity.

Their participation in an ostensibly assimilationist, progressive institution was balanced by congruities between traditional Haudenosaunee cultural elements and the activities of the WCTU. I argue that while both women were Christians and supporters of Euro-American educational practices, they worked to preserve many traditions of the Iroquois, notably women's participation in the political and familial realms. Thus, Haudenosaunee WCTU members both defended and redefined tradition while asserting their place in the twentieth-century United States.

"MARRIAGE TRAUMA" AND HOMOSOCIAL FIRST AID: Surveillance and Submission among Slaveholding Women	JOURNAL OF WOMENS HISTORY			English	Article								This article explores the networks of support, encouragement, and coercion that arose around the wedding preparations of a number of couples in North Carolina and South Carolina from the 1810s through the 1850s. Even as the appeal of couple-centered romantic love grew, many white southerners disregarded bourgeois self-discipline in marriage choices and adhered to older, aristocratic patterns of community surveillance. The homosocial networks that emerged around marriage rituals reveal how patriarchal ideology and incentives structured both men's and women's behavior. Whereas middle-class women's homosocial bonds gave them the strength to reshape patriarchal dictates or challenge male authority, southern women's "female world" aligned with, and in fact assumed, an aristocratic, patriarchal culture. By both the fact and manner of their submission to patriarchs, women placed themselves and their relationships at the center of what made their culture southern, and exceptional.

ARE TRULY OUR WORKING WOMEN": Gender Unity, Class Fractures, and the South Kensington Museum Model in Cincinnati, 1876-1890	JOURNAL OF WOMENS HISTORY			English	Article							19TH-CENTURY BOSTON; ENTREPRENEURSHIP; AMERICA; ART	While professional women artists responding to modernism's emphasis on individuality contributed to the 1890s decline of women's collective art culture, so did increased social class solidarity. Cincinnati's women museum advocates backed the goals of women's art culture embodied in Kensington-style institutions, including art training and decorative and fine arts parity. Women's art culture contained internal class tensions; women backed women's art labor both as a new artistic career path and as charity for the deserving poor. Cincinnati's women museum supporters exacerbated such class tensions when they targeted elite male donors by promoting art training to reform working-class men who lacked the unifying refinement that mitigated class tensions in women's art culture. Women thereby consolidated a cross-gender charitable elite patron class at the expense of women's art culture. Museum-trained women artists, furthermore, successfully advocated shifting to an institutional fine arts focus, addressing an elite patron class newly consolidated by women's museum advocacy.

J	Healy-Clancy, M				Healy-Clancy, Meghan			The Family Politics of the Federation of South African Women: A History of Public Motherhood in Women's Antiracist Activism: Winner of the 2017 Catharine Stimpson Prize for Outstanding Feminist Scholarship	SIGNS			English	Article							INTERNATIONAL DEMOCRATIC FEDERATION; GENDER; HISTORIOGRAPHY; MOVEMENT; WELFARE; RIGHTS	This article reexamines the roots of the Federation of South African Women (FEDSAW), the first national organization of women from all state-defined racial groups united against apartheid, founded in 1954. It argues that the deep history of public motherhood in southern Africa was what made FEDSAW possible: biological and symbolic motherhood had long been associated with responsibility for public social life in the region. Moreover, the article demonstrates that the first half of the twentieth century represented a time of profound transformation in the ways that women in southern Africa talked about and experienced motherhood. The influences of both missionary Christianity and international socialism encouraged women to claim that long-standing regional cultural forms of public engagements were an extension of private maternal responsibilities. African women talked about their public activism as emanating from an idealized private sphere to make themselves legible as social actors, both to agents of the white-controlled state and to allies in South Africa and across transnational networks. In turn, these allies emphasized their own public motherhood to legitimate themselves to African activists. Motherhood became a potent political discourse, even as activist women's control over their actual homes and family lives diminished under state oppression. This analysis therefore intervenes in a long-standing debate within South African feminist scholarship over whether FEDSAW's maternal politics were inherently conservative or radical by demonstrating that neither characterization is sufficient. FEDSAW's maternal politics were multivalent because of the history of gendered political communication and compromise out of which they emerged.

J	Roy, S				Roy, Srila			Enacting/Disrupting the Will to Empower: Feminist Governance of "Child Marriage" in Eastern India	SIGNS			English	Article							MICROFINANCE; GENDER; POWER; GOVERNMENTALITY; MICROCREDIT; CONSENT; RISK; NGOS	How is it that feminist strategies of empowerment and government can come to operate in a regulatory and coercive manner? While this question has been considered in light of the recent carceral turn involving feminist interventions into violence against women, it has not been explicated in the context of women's economic empowerment. This is in spite of increased evidence of nonstate actors, including feminist NGOs, operating coercively toward their target populations, namely poor women of the global South. Beyond the empirical evidence, our conceptual schemes also remain inadequate to capture the multiple workings of feminist governmentalities, rooted in sources of power that we tend to keep separate. A closer reading of governmentality, or the conduct of conduct, also provides a better sense of its flip side, namely counter-conduct, or the resistance that the governed might pose to the will to empower. The article probes the interrelated question of feminist conduct and counter-conduct in the unique instance of the governance of early marriage undertaken by a developmental NGO in eastern India. The NGO's campaign to curb early marriage brings into relief the dovetailing of different rationalities and techniques of government and types of power in ways that are currently underappreciated in analyses of feminism's imbrication in power. Marriage in this case serves to mark the limits of feminist governanceat the hands of different actors, discourses, and interestsin embodying and working against women's agency. It additionally shows that while subaltern women's counter-conducts can destabilize dominant governmental rationalities and their underlying relations of power, they do not necessarily constitute a more progressive politics.

The use of hymens in social and political theater can only be understood by appreciating that a woman's hymen, her sexual purity, and thus her social respectability are all simulacra, in the Baudrillardian sense: a substitution of the signs of the real for the real, and which are thus more real than real. This article analyzes hymens and graffiti as memory objects that construct idealized moral histories and that open up possibilities for creative maneuvers in the social construction of women's moral identities, drawing on the sensory registers of blood and hymens at the same time that they reveal these to be simulacra.

J	Yosef, R				Yosef, Raz			Conditions of Visibility: Trauma and Contemporary Israeli Women's Cinema	SIGNS			English	Article								The past decade has marked a renaissance of women's cinema in Israel. A new generation of female filmmakers is seeking to redefine the conditions of women's representability in Israeli society and cinema. In their films, they deal with current problems in the lives of women in Israel, or with issues that have been excluded from the public agenda. They identify and address actual female communities, foregrounding marginalized or emergent social groups within local feminism. They work with and against dominant forms of representation, shifting the traditional place of the gaze, blurring the boundaries between documentary and fiction, avant-garde and narrative, and directly addressing the film spectator as a woman. These issuesthe structure of the look and the reorganization of visionemerge especially in light of Israeli women's cinema's current preoccupation with female trauma, which in itself is embedded in matters of visibility. Focusing mainly on Michal Aviad's 2011 film Invisible, I argue that contemporary Israeli women's cinema invites us to question our viewing position of women's traumas. The new women's films do not attempt to depict female suffering realistically but rather to change the conditions of visibility of women's injury. In so doing, they challenge accepted patriarchal codes of spectatorship with respect to the woman and at her trauma. By proposing new ways of representing female pain from a female perspective, they seek to reclaim the gaze, to look differently and with fresh eyes, as an act of survival, on women's very existence in the shadow of ongoing trauma.

In this article, I consider how the atrocity has been mediated through multiple outlets in India as part of a reinvigorated aesthetics of grief, anger, critique, and protest against sexual violence. Building on earlier feminist modes of artistic engagement, I consider the Nirbhaya effect through outlets such as online films, canvas art, posters, photography, murals, comic books, satirical skits, and staged interventions on the streets that have been described as social experiments. These creative outlets may be considered in terms of five overlapping registers: memorialization, affirmative solidarity, ironic provocations, rescripting the master narrative, and sensationalization. Altogether, they indicate the many potentials and limitations of a violent wound in the social fabric, channeled through the creative arts and digital media.

J	Sheldon, MP				Sheldon, Myrna Perez			Wild at Heart: How Sociobiology and Evolutionary Psychology Helped Influence the Construction of Heterosexual Masculinity in American Evangelicalism	SIGNS			English	Article								During the 1990s, American evangelical texts contended that men have a stronger sex drive than women and that this natural sexual aggression makes men better suited to leadership roles in marriage, church, and society. Although this theology, called complementarianism, had earlier roots in conservative Protestantism, the connection that evangelicals made between male sexuality and male leadership was influenced by the scientific fields of sociobiology and evolutionary psychology during the 1980s and 1990s. These fields argue that maleness is a genetic evolutionary strategy characterized by social competition and a strong, even aggressive, sex drive. Evangelicals drew upon this scientific model in their efforts to combat second-wave feminism within their communities and in the broader culture. They turned to biology as a defense against the so-called cultural claims of feminism. Significantly, the model that evangelicals drew on from research in sociobiology and evolutionary psychology helped shape the articulations of natural masculine behavior in popular Christian self-help books, dating manuals, and theological texts. This article builds on the body of feminist scholarship that has critiqued the evidence, models, and popular influence of sociobiology and evolutionary psychology. But it also urges the importance of analyzing the role of religious practices in the circulation and legitimation of scientific depictions of gender and sexuality.

J	Hobson, J				Hobson, Janell			Celebrity Feminism: More than a Gateway	SIGNS			English	Article								We are presently in an era when celebrities have more access to social media outlets than ever before, which gives them an instantaneous voice through which to mold their identities and politics beyond the iconic or the symbolic. Sometimes, as our public surrogates, they express our feminist sentiments in the ways we approve of; at other times they do so in ways that we don't. However, Beyonce summarizes the issue as follows: I don't want calling myself a feminist to make it feel like that's my one priority over racism or sexism or anything else. I'm just exhausted by labels and tired of being boxed in. If you believe in equal rights, the same way society allows a man to express his darkness, to express his pain, to express his sexuality, to express his opinionI feel that women have the same rights. As she reminds us, celebrity feminism does not have to be confined to an identity or a way of life. It is itself a political process, participating in an array of feminist movements.

The Impact of Committee Composition and Agendas on Women's Participation: Evidence from a Legislature with Near Numerical Equality	POLITICS & GENDER			English	Article							HOUSE-OF-REPRESENTATIVES; SUBSTANTIVE REPRESENTATION; GENDERED INSTITUTIONS; STATE LEGISLATURES; US HOUSE; SEX; FAMILISM; TASKS; POWER	Previous studies of women's participation in legislative debates could not disentangle the possible effect of institutionalized gender discrimination from the effect of gendered patterns because of women lacking seniority and leadership posts. Costa Rica's Legislative Assembly offers an opportunity to control for seniority and leadership. The prohibition on immediate reelection means that no legislators have seniority. The country's successful gender quota, presence of an equal number of men and women committee presidents, and election of the first woman president in 2010 all point to women having relatively equal access to formal positions of power. In this context, unequal debate participation between men and women legislators would indicate that it is very difficult to change the gendered nature of an institution. We use multilevel modeling to analyze repeated observations of individual-level participation in three of six standing committees during the 2010-14 term (Agriculture, Economics, and Social Issues) to explore differences in patterns of participation under various conditions (sex ratios, discussion topics, sex of committee leaders). Findings indicate that women are active participants in committees with both stereotypically feminine and masculine policy jurisdictions, but also that women are more active when the gender composition of the committee is less skewed.

Here we create a unique content analysis dataset from 14 years (1998-2011) of plenary debates, including the contents of more than 150,000 unique MP speeches recorded in some 40,000 pages of the Ugandan parliamentary Hansard to test how MP characteristics affect patterns of gender-related legislative speech. We find that female MPs speak about issues related to women's interests significantly more than male MPs. Further, we find no evidence of significant differences between female MPs elected with and without quotas, suggesting that, in the Ugandan case, gender is a more salient predictor of the tendency to speak for women than electoral pathway. To our knowledge, this is the first study that examines the effectiveness of quotas in promoting women's substantive representation in parliamentary debates across all policy domains over a significant time period. We discuss the implications of these findings in the Ugandan context, as well as how our evidence speaks to substantive representation through reserved seat quotas in semi-authoritarian regimes more broadly.

J	Marien, S; Schouteden, A; Wauters, B				Marien, Sofie; Schouteden, Anke; Wauters, Bram			Voting for Women in Belgium's Flexible List System	POLITICS & GENDER			English	Article							POLITICAL-PARTIES; CANDIDATE GENDER; LOCAL ELECTIONS; REPRESENTATION; CHOICE; INFORMATION; PARLIAMENT; CONTAGION; CANADA; VOTERS	Proportional electoral systems tend to be more beneficial for women's descriptive representation than majority systems. However, within proportional systems the gender equality of election outcomes differs, highlighting the importance of studying the actual use of electoral provisions in proportional representation (PR) systems. Therefore, we investigate the determinants of voting for female candidates in Belgium's local elections. This case is particularly interesting given the equal number of men and women on the candidate lists due to quota regulations, the possibility to cast multiple preference votes (lowering competition), and the high visibility of these local elections and its candidates. At the individual level, we find that women are more likely than men to vote for several women, yet same-sex voting is more common among men. Politically sophisticated respondents vote more often for candidates of both sexes. Against our expectations, a left-wing orientation does not increase the likelihood of voting for women. At the electoral district level, a larger supply of women at the top list position increases the chance to vote for this top woman, but there is no spillover effect to women lower on the list. District magnitude affects the number of preference votes but, against expectations, not the likelihood of voting for women.

We discover men and women follow three career pathways post-graduation: lockstep (stable employment), transitory (3 or more employers), and exit (left workforce). While similar proportions of men and women followed the lockstep pathways and launched accelerated careers, sizable gender differences emerged on the transitory pathway; men's careers soared as women's faltered on this paththe modal category for both. On the transitory path, men fared much better than women when moving to new organizations, suggesting that gender may become more salient when people have a shorter work history with a company. Our findings suggest that clear building blocks to promotions reduce gender bias and ambiguity in the promotion process, but multiple external moves hamper women, putting them at a clear disadvantage to men whose forward progress is less likely to be stalled by such moves.

While some report this harassment, many leave their jobs to escape the harassing environment. This mixed-methods study examines whether sexual harassment and subsequent career disruption affect women's careers. Using in-depth interviews and longitudinal survey data from the Youth Development Study, we examine the effect of sexual harassment for women in the early career. We find that sexual harassment increases financial stress, largely by precipitating job change, and can significantly alter women's career attainment.

To Provide and Protect: Gendering Money in Ukrainian Households	GENDER & SOCIETY			English	Article						Money; Family; Culture; Masculinity; Ideology	DIVISION-OF-LABOR; MARRIAGE; WORK; POWER; ORGANIZATION; MASCULINITY; DEPENDENCY; HOUSEWORK; DIVORCE; CONTEXT	In this article, I advance a theory of gendered money and demonstrate how couples give special symbolic meaning to men's money in domestic exchanges. Unlike previous perspectives on gender and money such as resource theories and gender performance, this framework acknowledges money as a prop and tool that couples use to construct gender boundaries and signal normalcy in the marital relationship. Integrating concepts from economic sociology with Hochschild's insights on the symbolism of domestic labor, I find that Ukrainians use money as a token and symbol of value, not as a commodity with which to obtain desired outcomes. Drawing on in-depth interviews with 56 married and cohabiting individuals, I discover that couples subvert market meanings of money to enact a Soviet-style gender ideology. By spending men's money on necessary items and avoiding accessing women's money in the household, couples construct men's money as both visible and valuable while rendering women's money non-fungible. These practices highlight the primacy of culture and ideology over relative income, and can help explain the reproduction of male privilege in the household, despite gains in women's employment and earnings.

Secondary and 2-Year Outcomes of a Sexual Assault Resistance Program for University Women	PSYCHOLOGY OF WOMEN QUARTERLY			English	Article						sexual assault; intervention; resistance; self-defense; randomized controlled trial	SELF-DEFENSE; BYSTANDER INTERVENTION; COLLEGE-STUDENTS; DATING VIOLENCE; RISK PERCEPTION; HIGH-SCHOOL; RAPE; VICTIMIZATION; PREVENTION; AGGRESSION	We report the secondary outcomes and longevity of efficacy from a randomized controlled trial that evaluated a novel sexual assault resistance program designed for first-year women university students. Participants (N = 893) were randomly assigned to receive the Enhanced Assess, Acknowledge, Act (EAAA) program or a selection of brochures (control). Perception of personal risk, self-defense self-efficacy, and rape myth acceptance was assessed at baseline; 1-week postintervention; and 6-, 12-, 18-, and 24-month postrandomization. Risk detection was assessed at 1 week, 6 months, and 12 months. Sexual assault experience and knowledge of effective resistance strategies were assessed at all follow-ups. The EAAA program produced significant increases in women's perception of personal risk, self-defense self-efficacy, and knowledge of effective (forceful verbal and physical) resistance strategies; the program also produced decreases in general rape myth acceptance and woman blaming over the entire 24-month follow-up period. Risk detection was significantly improved for the intervention group at post-test. The program significantly reduced the risk of completed and attempted rape, attempted coercion, and nonconsensual sexual contact over the entire follow-up period, yielding reductions between 30% and 64% at 2 years. The EAAA program produces long-lasting changes in secondary outcomes and in the incidence of sexual assault experienced by women students. Universities can reduce the harm and the negative health consequences that young women experience as a result of campus sexual assault by implementing this program.

J	Bear, JB; Babcock, L				Bear, Julia B.; Babcock, Linda			Negotiating Femininity: Gender-Relevant Primes Improve Women's Economic Performance in Gender Role Incongruent Negotiations	PSYCHOLOGY OF WOMEN QUARTERLY			English	Article						gender; negotiations; gender gap; gender role congruity; primes	SELF-EFFICACY; BACKLASH; BEHAVIOR; METAANALYSIS; PROPENSITY; POWER; 1ST	According to gender role congruity theory, women, compared to men, underperform in masculine negotiations because these negotiations are incongruent with women's gender role. Based on this framework, we developed two gender-relevant primesa masculine-supplement prime and a feminine-complement primethat address role incongruity and should improve women's economic performance by either supplementing masculinity or complementing femininity. In Study 1, physicians (N = 78; 50% women) in an executive education program engaged in a masculine-supplement prime, which involved recalling agentic behavior; in Study 2, undergraduate students (N = 112; 50% women) completed a feminine-complement prime, which involved imagining negotiating for a friend. In Study 3, a community sample (N = 996; 46% women) completed an online experiment with the primes. Results from the three studies showed that these primes improved women's economic performance and eliminated the gender gap in negotiation. Perception of fit partially explained the efficacy of the masculine-supplement prime for women, though not the feminine-complement prime. We build on past research concerning situational moderators by investigating gender role congruity from an intrapsychic perspective. We also make a practical contribution; these primes can be used by women to improve economic performance in gender role incongruent negotiations.

The current research tested the effectiveness of two theoretically grounded sets of videos at increasing gender bias literacy as characterized by (a) awareness of bias, (b) knowledge of gender inequity, (c) feelings of efficacy at being able to notice bias, and (d) recognition and confrontation of bias across situations. The narrative videos utilized entertaining stories to illustrate gender bias, while the expert interview videos discussed the same bias during an interview with a psychology professor. The narrative videos increased participants' immersion in the story and identification with characters, whereas the expert interviews promoted logical thinking and perceptions of being knowledgeable about gender bias facts. Compared with control videos, the narrative and expert interview videos increased awareness of bias (Experiments 1 and 2) and influenced knowledge of gender inequity, self-efficacy beliefs, and the recognition of bias in everyday situations (Experiment 2). However, only the expert interview videos affected participants' intentions to confront unfair treatment.

Masculine women often negotiate dual stigmas due to both their gender nonconformity and perceived sexual orientation. Participants used a variety of strategies to cope with their stigmatized identity including modifying clothing; incorporating feminine behaviors to counteract masculine appearance; working in high-demand, undesirable jobs; working in male-dominated settings; and opting out of formal work organizations. While some participants experienced mistreatment in male-dominated settings, many reported positive outcomes including strong relationships with male coworkers, opportunities for advancement, and a general comfort in the work environment. Participants challenge Goffman's notion of sexual orientation as a concealable status, showing that sexual orientation minority women who are gender nonconforming employ strategies similar to members of other visibly stigmatized groups. Findings from this study suggest that researchers addressing sexual orientation minorities should include gender expression as a variable that can influence individual experiences and outcomes.

While feigning pleasure has been the subject of extensive scholarly inquiry, almost no research attention has been applied to women's experiences of resisting this normative practice. We adopted a discourse analytic approach to explore the question: If faking orgasm is often compulsory, how do women resist this practice and what does it mean when they do? Participants were 15 undergraduate students who ranged in age from 19 to 28. We identified the mobilization of several discursive patterns in their accounts. First, participants mobilized a future pleasures discourse to highlight the importance of resisting faking orgasm in order to increase their chances of experiencing genuine pleasure. Second, they positioned sexual satisfaction as an equal right to which they were entitled. In some instances, this was discussed in terms of reciprocity, in which pleasure is given and received. In others, it was positioned as a feminist issue of gender and power. Third, participants highlighted the importance of deflecting blame for absent orgasm in order to avoid hurting one's partner. Fourth, participants described the role of pain as either a factor that prevented them from faking pleasure or that motivated them to fake orgasm in order to end painful sex. We conclude that an equal rights discourse, framed as a feminist issue, holds the most promise as a means of discursive resistance. At the same time, we highlight the significant risks for women of both faking orgasm and not faking orgasm and the delicate discursive work required when an expected orgasm is not experienced. We suggest that efforts to support women's sexual health and equality are enhanced by better understanding the emancipatory potential of various discursive constructions as well as their limitations and risks. The merits and challenges of each pattern of accounting are discussed in the context of broader scholarship in the area of discursive resistance.

We tested the notion that making gender roles salient affects the strength of individuals' attitudes and the way they respond to persuasive information. In Studies 1 and 2, we found that priming women with the female gender role reduced the strength of their attitudes (Study 1, N = 50) and increased their susceptibility to persuasion through a low-thought process (Study 2, N = 98). In Study 3, we manipulated the salience of both the female and male gender roles among men and women and assessed persuasion to a counter-attitudinal message (N = 185). We found that the female and male primes affected men and women similarly, with the female prime causing participants to process messages superficially and the male prime leading to thoughtful message processing. These findings help to explain women's slightly greater persuadability in meta-analyses and provide evidence of harms that stereotypes about women can cause. Moving forward, we urge researchers to be wary of gender salience in the research context, especially when conducting persuasion research.

Television, Sexual Scripts, and Sexual Agency in Sexually Active Young Women	PSYCHOLOGY OF WOMEN QUARTERLY			English	Article						gender role attitudes; television viewing; sexual attitudes; psychosexual behavior	FEMININITY IDEOLOGY; ADOLESCENT GIRLS; EMERGING ADULTS; DOUBLE-STANDARD; COLLEGE-WOMEN; RISK-TAKING; ALCOHOL-USE; NORMS INVENTORY; CONDOM USE; ORAL SEX	Both traditional gender roles and traditional heterosexual scripts outline sexual roles for women that center on sexual passivity, prioritizing others' needs, and self-silencing. Acceptance of these roles is associated with diminished sexual agency. Because mainstream media are a prominent source of traditional gender portrayals, we hypothesized that media use would be associated with diminished sexual agency for women, as a consequence of the traditional sexual roles conveyed. We modeled the relations among television (TV) use, acceptance of gendered sexual scripts, and sexual agency (sexual assertiveness, condom use self-efficacy, and sexual shame) in 415 sexually active undergraduate women. As expected, both TV exposure and perceived realism of TV content were associated with greater endorsement of gendered sexual scripts, which in turn were associated with lower sexual agency. Endorsement of gendered sexual scripts fully mediated the relation between TV use and sexual agency. Results suggest that endorsement of traditional gender roles and sexual scripts may be an important predictor of college women's sexual agency. Interventions targeting women's sexual health should focus on encouraging media literacy and dismantling gender stereotypic heterosexual scripts.

In Study 1, a total of 654 women completed an online questionnaire including a pool of items designed to measure self-objectification. The item pool was constructed through focus groups and consultation with subject matter experts. Participants also completed existing measures of self-objectification and related constructs. A subset of participants completed the item pool at a 2-week interval to allow for assessment of test-retest reliability. A 14-item, two-factor measure of self-objectification was derived through exploratory factor analysis. Data provided evidence for the SOBBS's internal consistency and test-retest reliability as well as its convergent, discriminant, and incremental validity via its relations with interpersonal sexual objectification, body image, disordered eating, and depression. In Study 2, the factor structure of the SOBBS was reevaluated using confirmatory factor analysis and validity was again evaluated; SOBBS scores correlated with public body consciousness, private and public self-consciousness, self-esteem, and sexual functioning. We discuss implications for assessment of self-objectification as part of efforts in prevention and treatment of body image and eating disturbances. We hope the development of a new measure of self-objectification prompts further study of the topic and that increased knowledge about self-objectification allows clinicians and researchers to develop interventions that foster greater resilience against sexual objectification.

Participants (N = 160) read about attending a party where they saw a man lead an intoxicated woman into a private bedroom. The potential victim was referred to as having either a distinctively Black name (e.g., LaToya) or a non-distinct control name (e.g., Laura). After random assignment to one of these two conditions, participants reported on their intent to intervene and their perceptions of the situation and the potential victim. As expected, participants assigned to the Black potential victim condition reported less intent to intervene, less personal responsibility to intervene, and greater perceived victim pleasure than participants assigned to the control condition. Neither the certainty of risk nor the perceived victim blame differed as a function of the potential victim's race. In path analyses, personal responsibility to intervene mediated the relationship between victim race and intent to intervene. The current results suggest that White women in college may choose not to help Black women at risk for sexual assault. Bystander education programs should explicitly address race as a potential barrier to helping others in need.

By focusing on the early conceptual aspects of Bem's research, we describe three related but distinct impacts of that work. One impact was a social justice message of equality between women and men in the United States. A second impact was focusing research attention on gender roles as a malleable, socially constructed phenomena that, when polarized across gender groups, had negative consequences for psychological well-being. A third less obvious impact was helping scholars divest themselves of the previous, narrow understanding that gender was ultimately collapsible into a single dimension of masculinity-femininity. As with any new concept for its time, the legacy of psychological androgyny featured both backslides into and advances against the previous understanding of gender that it was designed to challenge. Our discussion of what we believe to be key functions and impacts of the concept of psychological androgyny serves to underscore just how important its introduction was and still is for ongoing gender scholarship and research.

Her work also provides a model for how to cross inter-disciplinary lines to enhance scholarship and reach political goals. We analyze similarities and differences between Bem's scholarship and scholarship in queer theory, a theoretical movement in the humanities that analyzes discourses that construct man/woman and straight/gay binaries. There are important overlaps between Bem's lenses of gender (biological essentialism, gender polarization, and androcentrism) and the ideas of many queer theorists. There are also several interesting differences between Bem's ideas and queer theory: attention to the intrapsychic processes that make up gender, the extent to which individuals can be liberated from gender, proliferating versus contesting gender, intersectionality, and epistemology and methodology. By assessing the similarities and differences between Bem and queer theorists, we show that the two complement each other, affording a better understanding of gender and sexuality. Additionally, both Bem and queer theory lend insight into feminist and queer activism. The theoretical and political advances that can be made by integrating Bem's ideas and those of queer theorists serve as examples for why it is worthwhile to cross disciplinary lines.

Self-report survey data from a U.S. sample of men and women recruited from Amazon's Mechanical Turk (25-89 years, M age = 47.38, SD = 14.05) were used to investigate the extent to which stereotypically masculine traits; stereotypically feminine traits; androgyny; gender identification (i.e., identifying with one's gender group and viewing this as a positive part of the self); and gender typicality (i.e., viewing oneself as a typical member of one's gender group) differ between younger (i.e., under age 40), middle-aged (i.e., ages 40-59), and older men and women (i.e., age 60 and older) and by marital status. Results indicate that gender differences in stereotypically masculine and feminine personality traits exist, and that marital status moderates age and gender differences in traits. Among older men, those who are married are more likely to endorse stereotypically masculine traits, but also have higher androgyny scores than unmarried men. With age, both men and women perceive themselves as more typical examples of their gender group. Results are discussed as providing limited support for crossover theory, but not degendering.

Language has been implicated as one factor, with masculine generic language (e.g., he used neutrally) leading to more androcentrism relative to its alternatives. However, the influence of two types of alternatives (e.g., they vs. he or she) remains unclear. The present study asked 297 male and female online participants from the United States to select typical representations of humanity from a set of White and Black male and female faces. The wording for the concept humanity was manipulated to be either a typical member of mankind, a typical human, or a typical man or woman (or woman or man). Overall, participants selected more White targets. Participants also selected more male targets, but the degree to which that was the case was affected by wording and participant's gender. Participants, particularly male participants, in the mankind and human wording conditions were more likely to select a male target as representative, whereas in the man or woman condition, participants' choices did not differ from chance. Thus, androcentric thinking may be more mutable than previously surmised, varying by participants' gender and by context.

In the present paper, we describe and evaluate a measurement technique that uses existing survey items to capture the extent to which an individual behaves similarly to their same-gender peers. We use data from the first four waves of The National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health), a nationally representative sample of adolescents (age 12-18) in the United States who were re-interviewed at ages 13-19, 18-26, and 24-32. We estimate split-half reliability and provide evidence that supports the validity of this measurement technique. We demonstrate that the resulting measure does not perform as a trait measure and is associated with involvement in violent fights, a pattern consistent with theory and empirical findings. This measurement technique represents a novel approach for gender researchers with the potential for expanding our current knowledge base.

Cognitive and Personality Characteristics of Masculinity and Femininity Predict Wayfinding Competence and Strategies of Men and Women	SEX ROLES			English	Article						Wayfinding; Masculine; Feminine; Cognitive; Personality; Orientation strategy	GENDER-ROLE ORIENTATION; SEX-DIFFERENCES; SPATIAL ABILITY; PSYCHOLOGICAL ANDROGYNY; STEREOTYPES; PERFORMANCE; IDENTITY; ENVIRONMENT; BEHAVIORS; TRAITS	Bem (1974) reconceptualized masculinity and femininity as independent and orthogonal constructs that both men and women possess to varying degrees. This perspective was used as a starting point to investigate whether the contributions of gender-typed characteristics can help to account for commonly observed gender differences in wayfinding (the ability to identify one's current location and successfully navigate to an unseen location in the environment) favoring men. We further divided gender-typed characteristics into cognitive and personality characteristics to assess their separate influence on wayfinding and explored whether gender-typed characteristics predicted self-reported use of masculine wayfinding strategies (i.e., orientation strategies) and self-reported wayfinding competence. Participants were 452 college women and men in a southern U.S. public university. They completed the Gender-Stereotypic Characteristics questionnaire (Diekman and Eagly 2000), a social comparison questionnaire (created by the authors), a wayfinding strategy questionnaire (Lawton 1994), and a wayfinding competence questionnaire (Hegarty et al. 2002). For both men and women, higher masculine cognitive characteristics significantly correlated with greater use of orientation wayfinding strategies typical of men. For men, both higher masculine and feminine cognitive characteristics predicted better overall wayfinding competence whereas for women, only higher masculine cognitive characteristics predicted better overall wayfinding competence. For both men and women, higher feminine personality characteristics predicted poorer wayfinding competence. These results demonstrated the importance of considering cognitive and personality characteristics of masculinity and femininity in explaining individual differences in wayfinding.

Whether this risk extends to male recreational athletes has not been explored. This study assessed associations between attitudes toward women, rape myth acceptance, and prevalence of sexual coercion among 379 male, undergraduate recreational and intercollegiate athletes and non-athletes. Our analyses showed significant differences between the responses of athletes and non-athletes for all dependent variables, and intercollegiate and recreational athletes on attitudes toward women and the prevalence of sexual coercion. Controlling for rape myth acceptance and traditional gender role attitudes eliminated differences between athletes and non-athletes in prevalence of sexual coercion.

It is believed that rape myth acceptance contributes to low reporting rates. We tested whether television sports exposure was indirectly related to higher acceptance of rape myth beliefs. An online survey involving 465 undergraduate students showed that viewing TV sports was positively related to hostile sexism, benevolent sexism, and sexual objectification of women. Through these variables, TV sports was indirectly and positively associated with rape myth acceptance. These results suggest that sports programming contributes to the perpetuation of rape myths in society.

Only 14% of the providers reported always screening female patients for IPV and about one third seemed never to screen. Female providers were more likely to screen and use recommended direct questioning. Most providers lacked confidence in screening, referral, and record-keeping. Serving a low-income population predicted more frequent screening and better record-keeping. Overall, IPV screening in primary care was inadequate and needs attention.

Such projects support researchers and practitioners working together to create uniquely comprehensive projects that have the potential to change practices, policies, and services.

In doing so, I focus on the rhetoric strategies used to describe the situation of (white) women and to legitimatize the fight against women's oppression. I show how the problem 'oppression'and the aim 'liberation'are framed by the metaphorical use of 'racism'and 'colonialism'. I propose to understand these strategies with Ann Laura Stoler as a symptom of colonial aphasia.

Reflections about the History of Conflict of the Women's Movement	FEMINISTISCHE STUDIEN			German	Article						German feminist movement; history of conflicts; feminist magazines; counterpublic; women's experience		Contemporary research on the history of the German feminist movement lays emphasis on the diversity of the movement and uses the plural form to underline this variety. The article demonstrates that the different strands of the feminist movement often do not have peaceful relationships with each other - an assumption that the focus on the plural form implies. The example of the controversy of three important magazines of the German feminist movement of the 1970s and 1980s Courage, Die Schwarze Botin and Emma - shows that the controversy and the quarrel about how the movement should understand itself and who should be its subject were essential to the movement. Central to the controversy was the question on how the magazines positioned themselves to the public and to the making of a feminist counterpublic as well as the meaning of women's experience for the movement. On the basis of this case study, the article argues that it is pertinent to understand feminist history as a history of conflicts.

J	Gehmacher, J				Gehmacher, Johanna			A Report of Travel Expenses. Economies and Publics of Being on the Road in Women's Movements around 1900	FEMINISTISCHE STUDIEN			German	Article						Travel; women's movements; economy; culture		Together with unfolding European women's movements, a multifaceted female culture of travel developed and enabled a considerable number of women to journey outside familial contexts. This development was promoted by the professionalizing of women, especially as teachers, as well as translocal and transnational networks of political and social movements. The article analyses forms of organization and effects of women's travel practices in different field of activities. Amongst other things it focuses on questions of economy and asks for varied individual and collective strategies to finance travel activities. Which (monetary and nonmonetary) resources could be activated, what kind of hierarchies and conflicts emerged around these questions?

J	Wolff, K				Wolff, Kerstin			Write 'Her' story. Women's Movement Magazines as a place of an early 'her' story?	FEMINISTISCHE STUDIEN			German	Article						women's movement; female magazines; 'her' story		This article analyses three magazines of the women's movement in Germany between 1890 and 1914. Clara Zetkin founded Die Gleichheit (the equality) for the female labor organization. Helene Lange edited Die Frau (the women) for the bourgeois-conservative wing of the women's movement and Die Frauenbewegung (the women's movement) was published by Minna Cauer for the left-wing civil women's movement. The article shows that in two magazines (Die Gleichheit and Die Frau) an early form of 'her' story was written in order to create and strengthen a corporate feeling as a basis for the women's movement and furthermore give the movement its own identity.

Daughters and their mothers: The reproduction of pronatalist discourses across generations	WOMENS STUDIES INTERNATIONAL FORUM			English	Article						Mother; Daughter; Generation; Pronatalism; Parenting; Mothering	EXPERIENCES; WOMEN; CHILDLESSNESS; VOLUNTARY; NO	The expectation that all women will become mothers, and that they will mother in particular ways, has been a focus of feminist attention for many decades. What has been less considered is how pronatalist discourses are reproduced across generations within the same family. This article draws on interviews with five pairs of white middle class daughters currently planning to have children and their mothers living in South Australia, in order to examine the ways in which mother-daughter relationships are a key site for the reproduction of pronatalist discourses. Three recurring themes are examined: 1) expectations mothers have of their daughters to have children, 2) (grand)mothers as advice-givers, and 3) generational differences relating to paid work combined with the continued privileging of mothering. The article concludes with a discussion of the ways in which pronatalist discourses are mobilised in mother-daughter relationships, and how these position women in relation to motherhood.

J	O'Connor, M				O'Connor, Monica			Choice, agency consent and coercion: Complex issues in the lives of prostituted and trafficked women	WOMENS STUDIES INTERNATIONAL FORUM			English	Article							SEX	This article examines the complexity of the concepts of choice, agency and consent in women and girls' entry into and experience within the commercial sex trade. Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis is used to analyse a series of in-depth interviews with prostituted and trafficked women in Ireland. The interviews reveal the circumscribed nature of individual choice and agency and the coercive context in which sexual consent is obtained within the power structure of the prostitution contract. The narrative accounts reveal the trauma of rape and sexual assault, but also the profoundly harmful consequences for women of acquiescing to multiple unwanted and degrading sexual acts for payment. This study also enhances our understanding that women's lived experience does not reflect a rigid demarcation between those who were coerced or trafficked, and those who are perceived to have exercised choice in their entry into prostitution.

J	Malatzky, CAR				Malatzky, Christina Amelia Rosa			Australian women's complex engagement with the yummy mummy discourse and the, bodily ideals of good motherhood	WOMENS STUDIES INTERNATIONAL FORUM			English	Article						Yummy mummy; Representation; Internalisation; Resistance; Maternal body/ies; Contemporary femininities		The celebrity "yummy mummy" is a popular and dominant contemporary representation of motherhood. Feminist analyses of the yummy mummy have predominately focused on textual readings of the Western cultural ideal of the maternal. This paper contributes to this body of scholarship by focusing on empirical data gathered from 29 women living in regional Western Australia. Representations of the yummy mummy regulate how women experience their bodies and their identities as mothers, and how they perceive other women. Analysing these representations provides a platform for talking about maternal bodies and the current societal pressures upon them, with the mothering ideal associated with the yummy mummy being in deep conflict with other dominant ideas about what constitutes good mothering. I argue that while women do not have many alternative discourses to draw on, they can engage in resistance work against the powerful ideal of the yummy mummy, often at the same time as desiring it.

This article investigates the impact of allies on social movements by analyzing the feminist protest within the Catholic Church in Franco's Spain and its male allies. Drawing on published documents and twenty-four interviews, I find that individuals can function as allies for movements. In addition, allies may predispose activists towards moderation in some domains but not necessarily in others. Moreover, allies may themselves be more radical than activists in some regards and thus have the potential to radicalize protests. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

This paper draws on findings from 14 semi-structured interviews with world class runners from Canada, the United States, the United Kingdom, Ireland, and Australia. We identified three main discourses: first, participants reported that support from their spouses, families, and sponsors allowed them to make meaningful decisions about elite sport and motherhood; second, elite female athletes reported feelings of guilt upon their return to training, which in turn, gave rise to a binary where athletes felt that motherhood necessitated selflessness and running required selfishness; finally, some participants reported that running/competition enhanced their mothering, transforming the ethic of care that informed their guilt into a site of empowerment.

J	O'Keefe, T				O'Keefe, Theresa			Policing unruly women: The state and sexual violence during the Northern Irish Troubles	WOMENS STUDIES INTERNATIONAL FORUM			English	Article						Sexual violence; Armed conflict; Northern Ireland; State violence; Gender	IRELAND; RAPE	Northern Ireland is not typically cited as an example of a conflict reliant on sexual violence. This is due, in part, to how wartime sexual violence is conceptualised, measured and normalised. Adopting a continuum of sexual violence model to view a range of abusive behaviours as interconnected the paper argues that a clear pattern of state-perpetrated sexual violence is discernible during the Troubles. Based on feminist ethnographic research it details how the state through prison authorities, police, soldiers and other security forces weaponised sexual violence as a means of disciplining and punishing republican women deemed deviant for transgressing gender norms. Two key interfaces where republican women regularly interacted with security forces during the war everyday policing and detention - illustrate both the importance of viewing the a range of sexually abusive practices on a continuum and how such practices were weaponised for the purposes of policing unruly, disruptive, transgressive women.

Based on 71 in-depth interviews with childless women between the ages of 25 and 40, the author proposes a holistic understanding of fertility inclusive of the biological limitations of the body as well as sociocultural factors including access to family leave, childcare, finances, housing, employment, and relationship status. By expanding our understanding of fertility to include the social, we can better understand why women considering having children advocate for social structural changes just as much as if not more than increased access to reproductive technologies.

As feminist social scientists have argued, power imbalances can affect not only the practical structure of interviews but also experiential and normative dimensions of the relationship that emerges between interview parties. At present, there are limited means to concretely analyse power differentials in elite interviews. This article addresses this gap by drawing upon feminist sociolinguistics to develop an original "power index" to measure power in the elite interviewing context within the social sciences. The index is applied to interview text to explore its utility and develop a method that can be fruitfully extended in future studies. (108 words). (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

There are discrepancies between the perceived needs of these individuals as assessed by the parents themselves, compared to the professionals who support them. Little is known about how individuals with learning disabilities view 'good parenting'. Method: After gaining informed consent, semi-structured interviews were conducted with eight women with a learning disability. Interviews explored their view on what makes a good mother and resulting qualitative data were analysed using Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis. Results: Four super-ordinate themes were identified: 'Mother as provider', 'A two-way bond' Motherhood transcends boundaries' and 'The same as anybody else?' Discussion: Some sub-themes mirror principles of Attachment Theory (Bowlby, 1982) including reciprocity, proximity seeking and a close mutual bond. Participants are aware of stigma surrounding disability and parenting and may be at risk of internalising such views to the detriment of their psychological wellbeing. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Findings suggest that the relationship between sources, settings, and evidence of empowerment is at times paradoxical, particularly for women who achieve equal or higher educational or earning status in relation to their male partners. Implications of these findings for the further refinement of theoretical models of women's empowerment which centralize an analysis of patriarchy are provided. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Family- and community-related determinants of intimate partner violence among Mexican and Puerto Rican origin mothers in fragile families	WOMENS STUDIES INTERNATIONAL FORUM			English	Article						Intimate partner violence; Family; Community; Hispanic mothers; Mexicans; Puerto Ricans	OF-THE-LITERATURE; ASIAN IMMIGRANT WOMEN; DOMESTIC VIOLENCE; COLLECTIVE EFFICACY; NEIGHBORHOOD DISADVANTAGE; MULTILEVEL ANALYSIS; GLOBAL PREVALENCE; AMERICAN WOMEN; GENDER; INFIDELITY	Hispanics are frequently categorized under one homogeneous group in existing intimate partner violence research, presenting a challenge for practitioners and researchers interested in assessing potentially unique public health concerns of each subgroup. Using the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study, this study examined the family- and community-related determinants of intimate partner violence experienced by mothers of Mexican and Puerto Rican descent. The respondents' self-reported physical violence and power control are two key measures of IPV. Our study found statistical differences between the Mexican and Puerto Rican origin respondents' experiences with IPV. Specifically, father infidelity and parenting concordance functioned as risk and protective factors, respectively, for the Mexican origin mothers' experiences of relational violence. In the case of the Puerto Rican origin respondents, higher level of spousal support, collective efficacy, and social disorganization were linked to less violence, while increased emotional distance and higher level of baseline education were associated with more violence.

International research that attends to the socio-cultural context of abortion evidences a fascinating variability of perspectives and attitudes about abortion, with some commonalities and patterns of resistance. Within accounts of Mori historical practice of abortion, there is some evidence of variability, and we sought to better understand the contemporary socio-cultural context surrounding Mori perspectives on abortion. As part of an Indigenous feminist (Mana Whine) interview study with 43 participants (26 women, 17 men), thematic analysis of participants' talk about abortion identified notions regarding protection of a new life, woman's individual choice, and extended family investment and support as foregrounded themes. We describe a rich and nuanced account of Mori perspectives on abortion, describing how these are structurally embedded within particular socio-historical and socio-cultural contexts, including Mori ideologies and theories, colonisation and Christianity, and women's rights activism.

Women's embodied experiences of second trimester medical abortion	FEMINISM & PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						second trimester abortion; embodiment; pregnancy; liminality; lived experience	STIGMA; PREGNANCY; ACCESS; CHILDBIRTH; SERVICES; BARRIERS; SCOTLAND; BRITAIN	Abortions in general, and second trimester abortions in particular, are experiences which in many contexts have limited sociocultural visibility. Research on second trimester abortion worldwide has focused on a range of associated factors including risks and acceptability of abortion methods, and characteristics and decision-making of women seeking the procedure. Scholarship to date has not adequately addressed the embodied physicality of second trimester abortion, from the perspective of women's lived experiences, nor how these experiences might inform future framings of abortion. To progress understandings of women's embodied experiences of second trimester abortion, we draw on the accounts of 18 women who had recently sought second trimester abortion in Scotland. We address four aspects of their experiences: later recognition of pregnancy; experiences of a second trimester pregnancy which ended in abortion; the labour of second trimester abortion; and the subsequent bodily transition. The paper has two key aims: Firstly, to make visible these experiences, and to consider how they relate to dominant sociocultural narratives of pregnancy; and secondly, to explore the concept of liminality as one means for interpreting them. Our findings contribute to informing future research, policy and practice around second trimester abortion. They highlight the need to maintain efforts to reduce silences around abortion and improve equity of access.

It does so through secondary analysis of young women's narratives from two qualitative studies in England and Wales. Whilst participants felt stigmatised by their abortion[s] in different ways, many also resisted stigmatisation. They did this through different stigma resistance strategies that were shaped by a number of different interactions: their socio-economic situations, family and relationships contexts, the circumstances in which they became pregnant, and their beliefs and values with respect to abortion and motherhood. Being able to construct their abortion decision as morally sound was an important element of stigma resistance. Although socio-cultural norms and values on abortion, reproduction, and motherhood were shown to constrain women's reproductive choices, these norms were all open to challenge. The women were more likely to struggle with their abortion decision-making when they had internalised negativity around abortion.

J	Chiweshe, M; Mavuso, J; Macleod, C				Chiweshe, Malvern; Mavuso, Jabulile; Macleod, Catriona			Reproductive justice in context: South African and Zimbabwean women's narratives of their abortion decision	FEMINISM & PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						abortion; decision-making; termination of pregnancy; reproductive justice; discourse; narrative; South Africa; Zimbabwe	LEGAL-ABORTION; PREGNANCY; EXPERIENCES; TERMINATION; CHOICE; CAPE	The abortion decision-making process is embedded within overlapping power relations. Using a post-colonial feminist framework, we analyse South African and Zimbabwean women's narratives regarding their abortion decision. As neighbouring countries, South Africa and Zimbabwe provide a useful counterpoint as they have common and differing social histories and very different abortion legislation. In our analysis, we unpick transversal commonalities and divergences in the discursive resources deployed by the women in their narratives in the two sites. Commonalities included the women feeling compelled to justify their abortion decision in the interactive interview space, an absence of a reproductive rights discourse, and the deployment of relationship embedded discourses in the justificatory work performed by the women. The conjugalisation of reproduction, imperative of good mothering, and unstable partner relationships discourses featured across both sites but the manner in which these were deployed differed. These discursive resources allowed the women to position themselves as making responsible decisions. The Zimbabwean women spoke of shame and hiding, a discursive resource that was explicitly absent in the South African women's accounts. We conclude by arguing that our post-colonial feminist approach allows for a contextualised reproductive justice stance to abortion decision-making that identifies both transnational and context-specific power relations.

Untroubling abortion: A discourse analysis of women's accounts	FEMINISM & PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						abortion; women's experiences; discourse analysis; subject positions; stigma	STIGMA; EXPERIENCES; BRITAIN; SINGLENESS; DISCLOSURE; DECISION	In this paper, I highlight key differences between a discourse analytic approach to women's accounts of abortion and that taken by the growing body of research that seeks to explore and measure women's experiences of abortion stigma. Drawing on critical analyses of the conceptualisation of stigma in other fields of healthcare, I suggest that research on abortion stigma often risks reifying it by failing to consider how identities are continually re-negotiated through language-use. In contrast, by attending to language as a form of social action, discursive psychology makes it possible to emphasise speakers' capacity to construct untroubled (i.e. non-stigmatised) identities, while acknowledging that this process is constrained by the contexts in which talk takes place. My analysis applies these insights to interviews with women concerning their experiences of having an abortion in England. I highlight three forms of discursive work through which women navigate trouble in their accounts of abortion, and critically consider the resources available for meaning-making within this particular context of talk. In doing so, I aim to provoke reflection about the discursive frameworks through which women's accounts of abortion are solicited and explored.

From childhood and her early years as a second wave feminist activist in Pittsburgh, Bem challenged established gender conventions including dress codes, segregated employment ads, workplace discrimination, and marital roles. We follow the trajectory of Bem's education and academic career, highlighting her three main contributions to feminist psychology: (a) psychological androgyny and the BSRI, (b) gender schema theory, and (c) the reproduction of sexual inequality via the lenses of gender. We also review her late life developments, such as her retraining in clinical psychology and her decision to end her own life after a diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease. Placing Bem's activist and academic work in the context of her personal struggle against gender expectations, we include her own voice to illustrate how she integrated the personal, political, and professional from the beginning of her life until her last days. We show that over the last four decades, Sandra Bem's contributions to theory and research transformed the study of the psychology of women in the United States and had an international reach-adding immensely to our understanding of gender roles, stereotypes, nonconscious gender ideologies, psychological androgyny, gender schemas, and gender-aschematic parenting, as well as how androcentrism, gender polarization, and biological essentialism work systemically and psychologically to reproduce gender inequality.

Masculine and Feminine Traits on the Bem Sex-Role Inventory, 1993-2012: a Cross-Temporal Meta-Analysis	SEX ROLES			English	Article						Change over time; Sex roles; Femininity; Masculinity; Androgyny	NARCISSISTIC PERSONALITY-INVENTORY; AMERICAN-COLLEGE STUDENTS; GENDER SCHEMA THEORY; PSYCHOLOGICAL ANDROGYNY; INTERNET USE; WOMEN; TIME; MEN; ADOLESCENCE; VALIDITY	The Bem Sex-Role Inventory (BSRI) is one of Sandra Bem's most notable contributions to feminist psychology, measuring an individual's identification with traditionally masculine and feminine qualities. In a cross-temporal meta-analysis of U.S. college students' scores on the BSRI (34 samples, N = 8,027), we examined changes in ratings on the Bem masculinity (M) and femininity (F) scales since the early 1990s. Additional analyses used data collected in a previous meta-analysis (Twenge 1997) to document changes since the BSRI's inception in 1974. Our results reveal that women's femininity scores have decreased significantly (d = -.26) between 1993 and 2012, whereas their masculinity remained stable. No significant changes were observed for men. Expanded analyses of data from 1974 to 2012 (94 samples, N = 24,801) found that women's M rose significantly (d = .23), with no changes in women's F, men's M, and men's F. Women's androgyny scores showed a significant increase since 1974, but not since 1993. Men's androgyny remained the same in both time periods. Our findings suggest that since the 1990s, U.S. college women have become less likely to endorse feminine traits as self-representative, potentially revealing a devaluation of traditional femininity. However, it is also possible that the scale items do not match modern gender stereotypes. Future research may need to update the BSRI to reflect current conceptions of gender.

If this is the case, femininity and masculinity may be better conceptualized as variable states rather than as stable traits. In the present study, we used Ecological Momentary Assessment to investigate variations in femininity and masculinity according to the gender of peers in female and male college students' real-life social contexts. Cisgender participants were recruited from a small liberal arts college in the northeastern region of the United States. Sixteen female and 11 male college students (M (age) = 20) contributed 448 reports documenting their social context and femininity and masculinity over a 2-week period. We found that men reported greater femininity on a momentary version of the Bem Sex Role Inventory (BSRI) when they were with women in comparison to when they were with men. We also found that both women and men reported greater masculinity on a momentary version of the BSRI when they were with men in comparison to when they were with women. Our findings lend empirical support to social constructivist models of gender and highlight the importance of investigating how interpersonal contexts contribute to gender-typed attitudes and behaviors.

Using survey methods, we drew from Sandra Bem's ideas to investigate whether gender differences in endorsement of communal and agentic conflict-management strategies varied depending on the peer relationship context. When gender differences were found, we investigated whether they were accounted for by masculine and feminine personality traits. College students (N = 116; 49 men and 67 women, 18-24 years-old) from the U.S. mid-Atlantic region rated stereotyped masculine and feminine traits as well as communal and agentic strategies for resolving hypothetical contexts in three peer contexts: same-gender friend, other-gender friend, and other-gender romantic partner. When conflicts involved a same-gender friend, women rated communal strategies higher than did men, but men's and women's ratings of communal strategies were similar in the other peer contexts. When conflicts involved an other-gender friend or romantic partner, women rated agentic strategies higher than did men, but men's and women's ratings of agentic strategies were similar when the conflict involved a same-gender friend. Women's greater endorsement of communal strategies for managing conflicts with a same-gender friend was partially explained by their being more likely than men to endorse stereotypical feminine personality traits. Results are discussed in light of Bem's (1974) once revolutionary, but still relevant, ideas that situational demands influence behavioral expressions of gender and that gender is a multidimensional construct.

Multiple logistic regression analyses revealed that participants with forced sex histories were 2- 8 times more likely to have higher rates of mental health problems, HIV risk behavior, and substance use. Qualitative analysis was used to supplement the quantitative results and give depth to our findings. Our results suggest that interventions for Asian American women who experienced forced sex should integrate mental health, substance use, and sexual health treatments.

Hierarchical logistic regressions showed that for men, violent/degrading pornography use, but not explicit but non-degrading pornography use, was significantly associated with reduced bystander willingness to intervene, but not associated with bystander efficacy. Women did not show the same impact of violent/degrading pornography use on the two bystander intervention variables. Results suggest violence/degrading pornography may contribute to a culture of acceptance of violence against women.

VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN			English	Article						domestic violence; time-out; perpetrator programs; batterer intervention programs		This article critically explores accounts of how men attending domestic violence perpetrator programs (DVPP) used the "time out" strategy. Findings are drawn from 71 semi-structured interviews with 44 men attending DVPPs and 27 female partners or ex- partners of men in DVPPs. We describe three ways in which the technique was used: first, as intended, to interrupt potential physical violence; second, through the effective adaption of the time-out rules by victim-survivors; and finally, misappropriation by some men to continue and extend their controlling behaviors. Policy and practice lessons are drawn from the findings through connecting broader and deeper measurements of what success means when working with domestic violence perpetrators to the ways in which the time-out technique was used.

Professional, conservative, and social justice views of the problem vary greatly. This article reports on the first findings from a systematic review of qualitative studies from 1989 to 2014. Forty-one studies were identified, and the narratives in them varied. Variation in perspective was related to the profession of the study author and whether the author professed a feminist and critical race perspective. Findings inform theory, practice, and policy.

Service providers participated in semi-structured interviews exploring these questions: Are service providers aware of instances of school sabotage occurring? What are the tactics that service providers have observed? What do service providers identify as the key impacts of school sabotage? The following are the themes: (1) tactics of abusive partners include disruption of financial aid, physical violence or stalking at school, and disrupting academic efforts; (2) survivors experience consequences, including emotional and academic impacts; (3) abusers display emotions including jealousy, resentment, and insecurity; and (4) many survivors use education as a pathway to safety and opportunity.

By using this approach, we are able to recognize the interplay and complexity between gender, class, and race that give rise to the inequality and oppression that experienced by EM women in Hong Kong. Findings of the study show that rape myths, gender-role perception, religion, kinship pressure, language barriers, citizenship, and immigration policy have constituted interlocking factors that shape the victim identity of EM sexual assault survivors.

This study utilized an online anonymous survey of U.S. military veterans (N = 25) to examine veterans' likability related to gender and level of combat exposure using frequencies, descriptives, and Mann-Whitney U tests. Results indicate that veterans prefer combat experienced and male soldiers. Female, noncombat exposed or injured veterans may be more socially isolated than their male counterparts following military service or deployment, illuminating potential barriers to help seeking and service provision with this vulnerable population.

Migrant women feature significantly in the staffing of the National Health Service and the social care sector, both currently under economic and political pressure. International labor mobility is also evident in the social work profession, though transnational social workers constitute only a very small proportion of the workforce. The recent vote to leave the European Union (EU) raises questions about the trend from recruitment of social workers from English-speaking countries to those from the EU.

Little research has focused on the daily and lived experiences of ageing, gender and sexuality in midlife, particularly when it comes to positive or more nuanced experiences. Based on ethnographic research in salsa classes with women in their fifties, this article explores the intersections and co-production of ageing, femininity and heterosexualities within particular spaces. Single women in midlife initially felt unsure of the rules of the road', out of place in social space. Salsa class spaces were produced as safe, alongside a safe sensuality' - which included embodying a glamorous salsa outfit but remaining respectfully feminine in age appropriate' ways. Participants navigated a way to become more' rather than less' of themselves with age, enjoying a second chance' which had not been afforded to the women of the generations before them. This article extends queer studies of space to account for ageing and for the (spatial) hierarchies embodied within heteronormativities.

This research centres on 15 semi-structured interviews with French women residents of diverse backgrounds. The interviews conducted represent counter-narratives to existing studies which focus only on highly skilled French migrants in London and define them as free movers and invisible migrants'. This study attempts to fill a gap by examining solely French women migrants in Manchester and London as a strategic research site for a number of key research questions taken from the current literature of intra-European migration, gender and identity. Indeed, the ways in which migrants negotiate their identity are crucial to migration studies and have to be analysed in relation to women's specific experience. The study exemplifies how migrants' identities are a ground of negotiation, contestation, deconstruction and reconstruction. Patterns that emerged in this study first highlight the high heterogeneity among women's strategies of self-identification and definition and sense of belonging in a changing Europe.

A Postfeminist Sensibility at Work	GENDER WORK AND ORGANIZATION			English	Article						discourse analysis; gender inequality; organization; postfeminism; sexism	GENDER; WOMEN; TALK	Postfeminism remains a relatively unexplored concept for scholars in the area of gender and organizations. In this article we first provide theoretical perspectives on postfeminism and elaborate a critical approach to it. Postfeminism is seen as a concept, rather than an identification, that can assist in understanding the patterning of gender in the modern workplace. The second part of the article illustrates different discursive moves that we observed in our own research exploring how sexism is repudiated and how gender fatigue is enacted. This meta-theme is supported by four discursive moves: first, gender inequalities are routinely allocated to the past or, secondly, to other countries or contexts; third, women are seen as the advantaged sex; and fourth, the status quo is accepted as just how workplaces are. The article thereby makes a contribution to understanding the patterning of a postfeminist sensibility both theoretically and empirically in the work context.

Acknowledging that women are interpellated within postfeminist discourses as empowered and autonomous subjects whose lives are shaped by individual choice, this article explores the implications for men, in particular how men variously perform postfeminist masculinities and the implications for addressing gendered inequalities within the workplace. Developing a research agenda, this article outlines three research trajectories: (1) problematizing a gender binary in which women are depicted as empowered at work and men in a state of crisis; (2) interrogating signs of new' postfeminist masculinities coded as inclusive in the workplace; and (3) examining how different types of men perform postfeminist masculinities at work. This article concludes by providing examples of research questions to generate future organizational scholarship in these areas.

J	Swan, E				Swan, Elaine			Postfeminist Stylistics, Work Femininities and Coaching: a Multimodal Study of a Website	GENDER WORK AND ORGANIZATION			English	Article						Postfeminism; coaching; popular psychology; multimodal methods	SELF-HELP LITERATURE; TALKING CURE; LIFE; DISCOURSE; GENDER; EXPRESSIONS; IDENTITIES; SEXUALITY; AUDIENCE; ECONOMY	The aim of this article is to examine representations of work femininities on a British website offering coaching specifically aimed at women. It builds on and contributes to studies of postfeminist representations but with a specific focus on work femininities and coaching webpages. Although studies on postfeminist representation have analysed the way young women's embodied and sexualized femininities are depicted across a wide variety of mainstream media, there has not been a study that focuses on the representation of work femininities on coaching websites. My approach matters because feminist authors critique popular psychology and link it to postfeminism and neoliberalism, but as yet studies have focused on self-help books and magazines and not on newer media. Furthermore, coaching websites are an important medium for circulating postfeminist work femininities and psychological advice, produced through the digital labour of women entrepreneurs. Through my analysis of one website, influenced by feminist social semiotic multimodality literature, this article contributes to postfeminist theory and organization studies by explaining how postfeminist stylistics' reproduce postfeminist tropes and depictions of relational and individualized entrepreneurial femininities visually and textually.

J	Sorensen, SO				Sorensen, Siri Oyslebo			The Performativity of Choice: Postfeminist Perspectives on Work-Life Balance	GENDER WORK AND ORGANIZATION			English	Article						choice; gender; performativity; postfeminism; work-life balance	ORGANIZATIONS; CONSTRAINTS; NORWAY; GENDER; MATTER; RACE	A strong emphasis on individual choice is considered to represent a particular neoliberal culture, and choice is claimed to substitute feminism. This article argues that the vocabulary of choice should not be seen only as a representation of a double entanglement of neoliberalism and postfeminism, but rather as a site for entanglement, and further explored as a performative concept. The argument is developed though empirical analysis of media texts on women combining career and motherhood. The metaphor of work-life balance is argued to function as a gendering frame as the particular combination of motherhood and career commitment is construed as conflicting dimensions of a feminine subjectivity. Within the gendered work-life balance framing the vocabulary of choice is performative, producing dichotomies and differences by the looks of individual agency. Thus, choice is not merely covering up power structures': the vocabulary of choice performs structuring power.

My analysis shows how achieving successful and therefore desirable balance requires one to embrace femininity but in a calculated, market-oriented fashion that benefits business goals, ensuring that one remains a good' postfeminist as well as neoliberal subject. I argue that this new femininity poses little challenge to the existing gendered power relations in organizations. The paper adds to the existing debates on doing gender in the workplace by providing an understanding of how and why certain ways of doing femininity in organizations are allowed or disallowed, specifically, how certain organizational femininity comes to be constructed as more successful and valuable in the contemporary postfeminist and neoliberal context. Furthermore, by examining how these ideals of balanced femininity are constructed in celebrity CEO autobiographies, the article highlights the value of exploring these texts as representations of contemporary postfeminist and neoliberal cultural norms.

While new laws criminalising this practice represent a positive step forwards, the legislative response has been piecemeal and typically focuses only on the practices of vengeful ex-partners. Drawing on Liz Kelly's (Surviving sexual violence. Polity Press, Cambridge, 1988) pioneering work, we suggest that 'revenge porn' should be understood as just one form of a range of gendered, sexualised forms of abuse which have common characteristics, forming what we are conceptualising as the 'continuum of image-based sexual abuse'. Further, we argue that image-based sexual abuse is on a continuum with other forms of sexual violence. We suggest that this twin approach may enable a more comprehensive legislative and policy response that, in turn, will better reflect the harms to victim-survivors and lead to more appropriate and effective educative and preventative strategies.

On the one hand, I consider legal documents, such as court proceedings, police reports, and the sentence. On the other, I analyse a life-history interview with one of the accused, thus giving her a voice that is not mediated by juridical institutions within criminal law procedure. This allows an analysis of two different subject positions produced by these texts: a conformist citizen and a feminist activist-citizen. I pay more attention to the latter. I conclude that in order to retain an activist position, the feminist subject has no option but to resist.

At the same time, scholars have observed limitations to this research agenda such as externally-driven definitions gendered harms and how to address them. This paper explores two novel areas for feminist TJ research: 'everyday gendered harms' and customary justice. Based on a three month field study of baraza, a customary justice mechanism in parts of South Kivu, Democratic Republic of Congo, I explore three cases of 'everyday' harms against women: domestic violence, polygynous relationships and witchcraft. Through a substantive examination of these baraza cases, I highlight how studying the contextualised functioning of customary justice mechanisms provides new insights into different areas of feminist TJ scholarship, including women's participation in the transition, justice for harms against women, and advancing gender equality. Additionally, this paper adds to the broader TJ literature by engaging with local TJ needs as they pertain to people's everyday life in transition.

Annelise Riles is the Jack G. Clarke Professor of Law in Far East Legal Studies and Professor of Anthropology at Cornell, and is Director of the Clarke Program in East Asian Law and Culture. Her work examines the transnational dimensions of laws, markets and culture across the fields of comparative law, conflict of laws, the anthropology of law, public international law and international financial regulation. Most recently Professor Riles has been examining the nature and meaning of the settlement made on the so-called Comfort Women, and what impact that has for locating events in the past. The Comfort Women were Korean women who were essentially captured and forced to work as sexual slaves for the Japanese army during World War Two. In 2015, Japanese and South Korean ministers agreed a settlement (comprising an apology and financial payment to provide for the women) in what they regarded as an irreversible and final settlement of the issue. Welsh and Riles exchange over their mutual interests in time and routinisation in this interview as they discuss what the story of the Comfort Women has to tell us.

In this article, we present qualitative research detailing the views of 13 participants from 10 women's support services in the Darwin area. We argue that women's support services bear witness to and are tasked with responding to the impacts of population change on women, yet their work is undermined by uncertainties that stem from neoliberal funding rationales and limited demands on companies to address social issues.

The reforms provided for a broader understanding of the context of family violence to be considered in such cases, but we found little evidence of this in practice. This is partly attributable to persistent misconceptions among the legal profession about family violence and why women may believe it necessary to kill a partner. We recommend specialized training for legal professionals and increased use of family violence evidence to help ensure women's claims of self-defense receive appropriate responses from Victorian courts.

Surveys with 152 domestic violence advocates and 46 victims show that technology-including phones, tablets, computers, and social networking websites-is commonly used in intimate partner stalking. Technology was used to create a sense of the perpetrator's omnipresence, and to isolate, punish, and humiliate domestic violence victims.

Technology-facilitated stalking needs to be treated as a serious offense, and effective practice, policy, and legal responses must be developed.

Nine central clusters emerged from the data analysis, which can be linked to three underlying themes: how the identification of mental health-related problems (i.e., labeling) could be misused when working with IPV survivors, ways screening can be appropriately used to help IPV survivors, and barriers that prevent screening. Findings highlight the importance of trauma-informed approaches across all aspects of service delivery.

In this study, we used narrative analysis methods to explore how nine Mexican immigrant women in the Northeastern United States described their experiences of intimate partner sexual violence, and how these stories were embedded within narratives of transition and movement across borders. We identified three major themes: The Virgin and the Whore, The Family, and Getting Ahead. We share important implications for researchers and health and social service providers working with this population.

We argue that placing Latinas at the center of analysis will facilitate empirical knowledge, which is necessary because mainstream inquiry has historically ignored their interests. First, we discuss cultural barriers through the lenses of gender, race, and ethnicity. Second, we describe socioeconomic barriers in conjunction with gender, race, and ethnicity. Third, we examine legal barriers along with the representation of gender, race, and ethnicity. Finally, we suggest directions for research and recommendations for service providers.

Tracing feminist history through female genealogy, Walbert's historiographic metafiction helps us think through the perils and potentials of the generational methods that have long dominated feminist historiography. Critically engaging with what has arguably become a feminist family drama, the novel makes an invaluable contribution to contemporary feminist theory and feminist historiography, illustrating of feminist genealogies as simultaneously fruitful and fraught, limiting and liberating and yet inescapable and useful.

J	Thwaites, R				Thwaites, Rachel			Making a choice or taking a stand? Choice feminism, political engagement and the contemporary feminist movement	FEMINIST THEORY			English	Article						Accounting; choice feminism; contemporary feminism; naming; politics	SELF	Choice feminism is a popular form of contemporary feminism, encouraging women to embrace the opportunities they have in life and to see the choices they make as justified and always politically acceptable. Though this kind of feminism appears at first glance to be tolerant and inspiring, its narratives also bring about a political stagnation as discussion, debate and critical judgement of the actions of others are discouraged in the face of being deemed unsupportive and a 'bad' feminist. Choice feminism also encourages neoliberal values of individualism and consumerism, while downplaying the need for political and collective action against systematic inequalities. Yet in order to succeed in creating change for women, debate needs to occur, and not all decisions can be supported if they act to further inequality and a patriarchal status quo. In this article, I would like to argue for the continued need to engage politically with other feminists and with the status of the movement as a whole, by critiquing choice feminism and looking empirically at how discussion and dissent can be silenced by the choice narrative. The empirical data in this article will focus on online discussions of naming on marriage to illustrate the wider theoretical argument.

Moving beyond cis-terhood: Determining Gender through Transgender Admittance Policies at US Women's Colleges	GENDER & SOCIETY			English	Article						women's colleges; transgender students; higher education; determining gender; gendered organizations	ORGANIZATIONS; QUEER	In 2013, controversy sparked student protests, campus debates, and national attention when Smith College denied admittance to Calliope Wong-a trans woman. Since then, eight women's colleges have revised their admissions policies to include different gender identities such as trans women and genderqueer people. Given the recency of such policies, we interrogate the ways the category "woman" is determined through certain alignments of biology-, legal-, and identity-based criteria. Through an inductive analysis of administrative scripts appearing both in student newspapers and in trans admittance policies, we highlight two areas U.S. women's colleges straddle while creating these policies: inclusion/exclusion scripts of self-identification and legal documentation, and tradition-/activism-speak. Through these tensions, women's college admittance policies not only construct "womanhood" but also serve as regulatory norms that redo gender as a structuring agent within the gendered organization.

Yet, we know little about the decision-making processes that lead to such outcomes. To address this gap, I conducted a longitudinal interview study of 21 heterosexual young adult couples who were deciding whether to move for early career opportunities. Analyzing 118 interviews, I detail how partners negotiate their desired work and family arrangements given structural and cultural constraints. On one negotiation trajectory, partners maintained their egalitarian desires by performing practical labor to make equal work-family arrangements. On another pathway, couples changed their desires by doing emotion work to justify neotraditional roles. On the last pathway, men deferred to women's desires, unintentionally leaving women the emotional and practical work of coordinating two careers and the couple's life. These pathways show how couples contest and reproduce gendered work and family roles during the stalled gender revolution.

Aggressive And Loving Men: Gender Hegemony in Christian Hardcore Punk	GENDER & SOCIETY			English	Article						hybrid masculinities; hegemonic masculinity; homosocial bonds; evangelicalism; music	MIXED MARTIAL ARTS; HYBRID MASCULINITIES; MANHOOD ACTS; MUSIC SCENE; MOVEMENT; POLITICS; RELIGION; CULTURE; CHURCH; WOMEN	This research uses Christian Hardcore punk to show how evangelical Christian men respond to changes in gender relations that threaten hegemonic masculinity through a music subculture. Drawing on interviews and participant observations of live music shows, I find that Christian Hardcore ministry involves a hybrid mix of aggressive and loving performances of manhood. Christian Hardcore punk men fortify the idea that men and women are essentially opposites through discourse and the segregation of music spaces, even as they deviate from dominant ideas of what makes a man in their strategy of openly expressing the "loving" of secular men. The mechanism for this is the interactions in concert spaces. These findings offer a conceptual move away from studying "godly" masculinity as intrinsically distinct from secular masculinity and illustrate how religious masculinities can be both hegemonic and "soft."
