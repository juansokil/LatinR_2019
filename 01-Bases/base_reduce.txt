INTER-PROVINCIAL MIGRATION EFFECT ON YOUTH RISK BEHAVIORS IN SOUTH AFRICA: A MULTILEVEL ANALYSIS OF CONTEXTUAL- AND INDIVIDUAL-LEVEL FACTORS	COGENT SOCIAL SCIENCES	BACKGROUND: THIS STUDY COMPARED THE PARTICIPATION OF INTER-PROVINCIAL MIGRANT AND NON-MIGRANT SOUTH AFRICAN YOUTHS IN RISK BEHAVIORS (RBS), AND INVESTIGATED THE CONTEXTUAL AND INDIVIDUAL FACTORS THAT INFLUENCED THEIR PARTICIPATION IN RBS. METHOD: DATA WAS FROM THE NATIONAL INCOME DYNAMICS STUDY (NIDS), WAVE 3 OF 2014 WHICH WAS A SURVEY OF INDIVIDUALS AND HOUSEHOLDS LIVING IN THE NINE PROVINCES OF SOUTH AFRICA. A TOTAL OF 5590 YOUNG PEOPLE AGED 15-24 YEARS WERE USED FOR THIS STUDY. SMOKING OF CIGARETTES AND DRINKING OF ALCOHOL WERE USED AS THE TWO OUTCOME VARIABLES OF RISK BEHAVIORS. DATA ANALYSIS WAS WITH UNIVARIATE, BIVARIATE, AND MULTI-LEVEL LOGISTIC REGRESSION TECHNIQUES. RESULTS: WHILE 12.67% OF THE YOUTHS WERE SMOKERS, 26.70% WERE DRINKERS. IN ADDITION, MORE OF THE NON-MIGRANTS WERE ENGAGED IN SMOKING AND DRINKING COMPARED TO MIGRANTS. WITH THE EXCEPTION OF SELF-RATED PHYSICAL HEALTH AND MARITAL STATUS, THE RESULTS SHOWED SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES IN SMOKING AND DRINKING AMONG MIGRANTS AND NON-MIGRANTS IN OTHER CONTEXTUAL AND INDIVIDUAL VARIABLES. PROVINCE OF RESIDENCE AND LIVING IN URBAN AREAS SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED THE ODDS OF SMOKING AND DRINKING AMONG THE MIGRANTS AND NON-MIGRANTS. OTHER CONTEXTUAL FACTORS THAT INCREASED THE ODDS OF DRINKING AND SMOKING IN THE STUDY AREA WERE POOR MENTAL HEALTH STATUS, AND GOOD SELF-RATED HEALTH OF NON-MIGRANTS (1.42; P < 0.05), AND MIGRANTS (1.40; P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: INTERVENTION MEASURES/STRATEGIES SHOULD INCLUDE PROVISION OF COUNSELING CENTERS, IMPROVEMENT IN THE EDUCATION OF THE YOUTH AND INCREASED MEDIA REPORTAGE ON THE DANGERS OF PARTICIPATION IN THESE RISK BEHAVIORS.

FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT THERE ARE PARTICULAR ISSUES FOR FEMALE DELEGATES WHICH HAVE NOT ARISEN IN PREVIOUS STUDIES. THESE INCLUDE NOT ONLY THE IMPORTANCE OF HAVING STRONG FEMALE ROLE MODELS AND THE SIGNIFICANCE OF FUN AND FRIENDSHIP, BUT ALSO THE PROMINENT ROLE OF EMOTIONS, CARER RESPONSIBILITIES, SAFETY CONCERNS, AND HARASSMENT.

THE #METOO MOVEMENT HAS FOCUSED OUR ATTENTION ON THE PREVALENCE OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT AND ABUSE IN A RANGE OF CONTEXTS, INCLUDING IN HOLLYWOOD, THE MEDIA INDUSTRY, WESTMINSTER, SCIENCE AND ACADEMIA. MEDIA REPORTING OF THESE HIGH-PROFILE CASES REPRESENTS THE PERPETRATORS OF THESE CRIMES AS 'MONSTERS', 'SEX PESTS', AS HIGHLY UNUSUAL OR DEVIANT INDIVIDUALS. WE ARGUE HERE, THAT RATHER, SUCH PRACTICES PERVADE A RANGE OF CONTEXTS, INCLUDING EDUCATIONAL ONES, AND ARE NORMALISED AND 'HIDDEN' WITHIN THESE SETTINGS. WE WILL DRAW ON OUR RECENT RESEARCH ON 'LAD CULTURE' IN HIGHER EDUCATION TO DISCUSS HOW HARASSMENT AND SEXUAL ABUSE ARE NORMALISED IN CERTAIN UNIVERSITY CONTEXTS. OUR PIECE WILL EXPLORE HOW SUCH CULTURES SILENCE SURVIVORS AND MASK, OR MAKE INVISIBLE, INSTANCES OF EVERYDAY SEXISM AND HARASSMENT AND HOW SUCH SILENCING CAN PERPETUATE THE NOTION THAT INDIVIDUAL 'MONSTERS' COMMIT SUCH ACTS. DRAWING ON INTERVIEWS WITH STAFF WORKING IN UNIVERSITIES, THIS PIECE SHOWS HOW SEXUAL HARASSMENT IS MIS-PERCEIVED, JUSTIFIED AND MINIMISED (PARTICULARLY IN RELATION TO LESS VISIBLE EXAMPLES OF DEGRADATION OR ABUSE OF WOMEN) AND HOW THE NOTION OF THE 'PROBLEMATIC INDIVIDUAL' PREVAILS IN FAVOUR OF A STRUCTURAL, GENDERED ANALYSIS OF HARASSMENT AND VIOLENCE.

THIS STUDY EXAMINED EXPOSURE TO INTIMATE PARTNER VIOLENCE (IPV), FAMILY VIOLENCE, AND BELIEFS ABOUT VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN (VAW) IN A CONVENIENCE SAMPLE OF 2,462 ADOLESCENTS FROM 44 SCHOOLS IN NIGERIA AND SOUTH AFRICA. FINDINGS SUGGESTED THAT EXPOSURE TO IPV, FAMILY VIOLENCE, AND BELIEFS ABOUT VAW DIFFERED BY GENDER AND COUNTRY. SPECIFICALLY, ADOLESCENTS FROM NIGERIA WERE MORE LIKELY TO BE EXPOSED TO IPV AND FAMILY VIOLENCE AND WERE MORE LIKELY TO ENDORSE VAW THAN ADOLESCENTS FROM SOUTH AFRICA. MALE ADOLESCENTS WERE MORE LIKELY TO ENDORSE VAW THAN WERE FEMALE ADOLESCENTS. SIMILARLY, HIGHER AGE, BEING MALE, BEING FROM NIGERIA, BEING IN A RELATIONSHIP, AND GREATER EXPOSURE TO FAMILY VIOLENCE WERE ASSOCIATED WITH HIGHER ENDORSEMENT OF VAW. FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT EFFECTIVE PREVENTION PROGRAMS ARE NEEDED IN BOTH COUNTRIES TO MITIGATE EXPOSURE TO IPV AND FAMILY VIOLENCE.

THE STUDY ALSO EXPLORES THE INFLUENCE OF CONSUMER CHARACTERISTICS (I.E. GENDER, EDUCATION, RELIGIOSITY, GENERATIONAL IDENTITY AND RELATIONSHIP TO A PERSON WITH A DISABILITY) ON SERVICE DELIVERY QUALITY PERCEPTIONS AND STEREOTYPING. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH USING DIFFERENT TYPES OF DISABILITIES, THE STUDY USES A CONTROLLED EXPERIMENT, FOLLOWED BY A SURVEY, TO EVALUATE CONSUMERS' PERCEPTION OF SERVICE QUALITY DELIVERY OF A HOTEL FRONT OFFICE STAFF MEMBER. FINDINGS THE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT THERE ARE NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES IN THE PERCEPTIONS OF SERVICE QUALITY DELIVERY AND STEREOTYPING FOR SERVICE EMPLOYEES WITH DISABILITIES WITH THE EXCEPTION OF EMPLOYEES WITH A VISUAL IMPAIRMENT. THE STUDY FOUND THAT PARTICIPANTS, WHO HAD A CLOSE FRIEND OR FAMILY MEMBER WITH A DISABILITY, EXPRESSED LESS STEREOTYPING THAN THOSE WHO DID NOT HAVE A CLOSE FRIEND OR FAMILY MEMBER WITH A DISABILITY. RESEARCH LIMITATIONS/IMPLICATIONS REAL SERVICE ENCOUNTERS CAN BE USED WHERE PARTICIPANTS MIGHT BE MORE INVOLVED IN THE SERVICE PROCESS THAN IN A CONTROLLED EXPERIMENT SETTING. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS THE FINDINGS PROVIDE SUPPORT TO HUMAN RESOURCE MANAGEMENT IN STRATEGICALLY PLACING PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES INTO FRONT-LINE POSITIONS BECAUSE THEY SATISFACTORILY REPRESENT THE IMAGE OF THE COMPANY AND GUESTS CONSIDER THEIR SERVICE PROFESSIONAL AND RELIABLE. SOCIAL IMPLICATIONS THE STUDY'S FINDINGS SUPPORT THAT EMPLOYERS SHOULD TAP INTO THE UNDER-UTILIZED WORKFORCE OF PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES AND AVOID PRE-EXISTING STEREOTYPING. ORIGINALITY/VALUE A MAJOR CONCERN OF HOSPITALITY COMPANIES MAKING EMPLOYMENT DECISIONS ABOUT HIRING PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES IS GUESTS' ATTITUDE.

SPECIFICALLY, WE EXPLORE HOW THE DECISION TO REVEAL DUAL-CAREER STATUS IN THE ACADEMIC JOB SEARCH PROCESS IMPACTS FACULTY MEMBERS' LATER PROMOTIONS, PRODUCTIVITY, PAY, MOBILITY, AND CAREER-RELATED GOALS. WE DRAW ON A SAMPLE OF ROUGHLY 230 FACULTY IN SEVEN US UNIVERSITIES WHO WERE PART OF A DUAL-CAREER COUPLE AT THEIR TIME OF HIRE. WE FIND THAT RISK-TAKING DURING THE JOB SEARCH IMPACTS SOME CAREER OUTCOMES, AND DOES SO SIMILARLY FOR WOMEN AND MEN. MEMBERS OF A DUAL-CAREER COUPLE WHO TOOK THE RISK OF REVEALING THEIR DUAL-CAREER STATUS BEFORE A JOB OFFER REPORTED SIGNIFICANTLY MORE POSITIVE CAREER EXPERIENCES RELATED TO PROMOTION AND PRODUCTIVITY THAN THOSE WHO DID NOT REVEAL THEIR STATUS DURING THE JOB SEARCH. ONLY THE SALARY OUTCOME WAS NEGATIVELY RELATED TO REVEALING DUAL-CAREER STATUS IN THE JOB SEARCH PROCESS. BECAUSE OF THE NATURE OF ACADEMIC HIRING, REVEALING A RISKY STATUS DURING THE JOB SEARCH PROCESS MAY AMELIORATE BARRIERS TO EMPLOYMENT.

NEVERTHELESS, IN SOME SOCIETIES, INFERTILITY IS FREQUENTLY SEEN AS SOLELY A WOMAN'S PROBLEM AND WOMEN WITH INFERTILITY PROBLEMS ARE OFTEN FORCED TO SUFFER BLAME AND HUMILIATION IN SILENCE. FOR EXAMPLE, IN MALAYSIA, A BARREN MARRIED WOMAN IS LOOKED DOWN UPON, HAS A LOWER STATUS, AND MAY BE DIVORCED FROM HER HUSBAND. INFERTILITY BECOMES A TABOO TOPIC AND THEREFORE, NOT MUCH IS KNOWN ABOUT MALAYSIAN WOMEN WITH INFERTILITY PROBLEMS. HOWEVER, WITH THE ANONYMITY AFFORDED BY COMPUTER-MEDIATED COMMUNICATION (CMC), THESE WOMEN ARE NOW TURNING TO THE ONLINE MEDIUM FOR HELP.

THE PERCEIVED TEACHERS' SELF-DISCLOSURE SCALE, WHICH INDEXES THREE ASPECTS OF TEACHER SELF-DISCLOSURE NAMELY AMOUNT, RELEVANCE, AND NEGATIVITY WAS USED TO DETERMINE THE UNDERGRADUATES' PERCEPTIONS OF THEIR PERCEIVED TEACHERS' SELF-DISCLOSURE. SCORES FOR WRITING PERFORMANCE WERE GATHERED FROM THE RESULTS OBTAINED BY THE STUDENTS IN THEIR FINAL EXAMINATION FOR THE WRITING COURSE. THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PERCEIVED TEACHER SELF-DISCLOSURE AND WRITING PERFORMANCE WAS ANALYZED USING THE PEARSON PRODUCT-MOMENT CORRELATIONS TEST. THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN PERCEIVED TEACHER SELF-DISCLOSURE AND GENDER WAS ANALYZED USING THE INDEPENDENT SAMPLE T-TEST. THE RESULTS SHOWED A SMALL, POSITIVE CORRELATION BETWEEN TWO ASPECTS OF TEACHER SELF-DISCLOSURE (AMOUNT AND RELEVANCE) AND WRITING PERFORMANCE. THE RESULTS FROM THIS STUDY DEMONSTRATED THAT ESL STUDENTS PERCEIVED THAT RELEVANT TEACHER SELF-DISCLOSURE, RELATING TO COURSE CONTENT, HAD IMPORTANT IMPLICATIONS FOR THEIR WRITING PERFORMANCE. THUS, TEACHER SELF-DISCLOSURE IS AN IMPORTANT ELEMENT OF CLASSROOM INSTRUCTION THAT COULD BE USED TO ENHANCE CONTENT KNOWLEDGE, ESPECIALLY IN IDEA GENERATING, SELF-VOICE AND OPINION AMONG ESL STUDENTS IN A WRITING CLASS. THE RESULTS ALSO SHOWED A SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE IN ONE DIMENSION OF TEACHER SELF-DISCLOSURE, NEGATIVITY, AND GENDER. FURTHER COMPREHENSIVE STUDIES SHOULD BE CONDUCTED TO GAUGE THE IMPLICATIONS OF PERCEIVED TEACHERS' SELF-DISCLOSURE TO THE TEACHING AND LEARNING ASPECTS IN ESL WRITING CLASSROOMS.

AN ADAPTED VERSION OF THE CORNELL CLASS-REASONING TEST FORM X WAS ADMINISTERED TO 60 STUDENTS WHO HAD JUST GRADUATED HIGH SCHOOL AND ENTERED THE UNIVERSITY. DESCRIPTIVE ANALYSIS OF TEST RESULTS REVEALED THAT PARTICIPANTS HAD FAILED TO MASTER FOUR OF THE FIVE PRINCIPLES ASSESSED BY THE TEST'S ITEM GROUPS, WHILE RECEIVING SCORES THAT SUGGESTED NEITHER MASTERY NOR FAILURE TO MASTER THE REMAINING PRINCIPLE. THE OVERALL AVERAGE CORRECT PERCENTAGE FOR THE SAMPLE OF 45.8% WAS COMPARABLE TO RESULTS FROM GRADE 4 STUDENTS IN THE UNITED STATES OFFERED BY THE TEST CREATORS. INDEPENDENT SAMPLES T-TESTS INDICATED STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES ON OVERALL TEST SCORES BASED ON GENDER AND LEVEL OF STUDY IN THE ENGLISH FOUNDATION PROGRAM, ALTHOUGH NO DIFFERENCES BASED ON AGE WERE FOUND.

CYCLIST CASUALTY SEVERITY AT ROUNDABOUTS - TO WHAT EXTENT DO THE GEOMETRIC CHARACTERISTICS OF ROUNDABOUTS PLAY A PART?	JOURNAL OF SAFETY RESEARCH	INTRODUCTION: IN GENERAL, PRIORITY JUNCTIONS ARE CONVERTED INTO ROUNDABOUTS TO INCREASE CAPACITY AND REDUCE VEHICLE ACCIDENTS. HOWEVER, PREVIOUS RESEARCH HAS INDICATED THAT ROUNDABOUTS ARE DANGEROUS FOR VULNERABLE USERS, ESPECIALLY CYCLISTS. METHOD: THIS PAPER INVESTIGATES WHICH DESIGN FACTORS INFLUENCE CYCLIST CASUALTY SEVERITY AT GIVE WAY (NON-SIGNALIZED) ROUNDABOUTS WITH MIXED TRAFFIC, USING THE UK STATS19 NATIONAL DATASET OF CYCLIST CASUALTIES. FIRST, THE CORRELATION MATRIX WAS GENERATED TO OBSERVE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN VARIABLES. SECOND, DIMENSION REDUCTION WAS APPLIED TO GEOMETRIC DESIGN VARIABLES IN ORDER TO REDUCE THE NUMBER OF VARIABLES AND GENERATE THE FACTORS. FINALLY, THE BINARY LOGISTIC REGRESSION METHOD, WITH SERIOUS AND SLIGHT CASUALTIES AS DEPENDENT VARIABLES, WAS APPLIED IN THREE STEPS. THE FIRST BINARY LOGISTIC REGRESSION MODEL (BLRM) INCLUDED SPEED LIMIT, SOCIODEMOGRAPHIC, AND METEOROLOGICAL CONDITIONS. THE VARIABLES IN THE SECOND BLRM CONSISTED OF GEOMETRIC DESIGN VARIABLES. THE THIRD BLRM INCLUDED THE FACTORS THAT WERE GENERATED BY DIMENSION REDUCTION. RESULTS: THE CORRELATION MATRIX REVEALED THAT THE NUMBER OF LANES ON APPROACH AND HALF WIDTH ON APPROACH WERE STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANTLY CORRELATED, WHILE THE VARIABLES, SUCH AS GEOMETRIC DESIGN (ENTRY PATH RADIUS, NUMBER OF ARMS, NUMBER OF FLARE LANES ON APPROACH, TYPE OF ROUNDABOUT AND NUMBER OF CIRCULATING LANES), SOCIODEMOGRAPHIC (CASUALTY GENDER AND AGE), SPEED LIMIT AND METEOROLOGICALLY RELATED FACTORS (DAYLIGHT, WEATHER AND ROAD SURFACE CONDITION), DID NOT SHOW ANY STATISTICAL SIGNIFICANCE. FROM THE DIMENSION REDUCTION PROCESS, TWO MAIN FACTORS WERE IDENTIFIED, INCLUDING APPROACH CAPACITY (FACTOR 1) AND SIZE OF ROUNDABOUT (FACTOR 2), AND THEY WERE SUBSEQUENTLY USED AS INDEPENDENT VARIABLES IN THE LOGISTIC REGRESSION ANALYSIS. THE SUBSEQUENT BLRMS SHOWED THAT A HIGHER SPEED LIMIT REDUCES THE SAFETY FOR CYCLISTS AT ROUNDABOUTS. THE PROBABILITY OF A SERIOUS CASUALTY INCREASES BY APPROXIMATELY FIVE TIMES (ODDS RATIO 4.97) FOR EACH ADDITIONAL NUMBER OF LANES ON APPROACH AND BY 4% (ODDS RATIO 1.04) WITH A HIGHER ENTRY PATH RADIUS. IT WAS ALSO FOUND THAT FACTOR 2 (APPROACH CAPACITY) INCREASES THE CASUALTY SEVERITY (ODDS RATIO 1.86) FOR CYCLISTS AT ROUNDABOUTS. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: WHILE THIS RESEARCH STUDIED ROUNDABOUTS IN THE UK, THE METHODOLOGICAL APPROACH AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS TECHNIQUES ARE APPLICABLE TO OTHER COUNTRIES AND THE FINDINGS ARE LIKELY TO BE OF VALUE TO DECISION MAKERS WORLDWIDE.

METHOD: TO CREATE EFFECTIVE INTERVENTION PROGRAMS, RESEARCH ON HOW BOYS AND GIRLS OF PARTICULAR AGES BEHAVE AS PEDESTRIANS, AND WHETHER THERE ARE GENDER DIFFERENCES THAT INCREASE RISK FOR PARTICULAR GENDERS AT PARTICULAR AGES, IS NEEDED. IN THIS STUDY, 255 BOYS AND 235 GIRLS IN GRADE 1 THROUGH 6 FROM TWO PRIMARY SCHOOLS IN NANTONG CITY, CHINA, WERE UNOBTRUSIVELY VIDEOTAPED WHEN WALKING TO SCHOOL IN THE MORNING. VIDEOTAPES WERE REVIEWED AND CODED FOR SEVEN PEDESTRIAN SAFETY BEHAVIORS, INCLUDING ACTIVITIES RELATED TO CROSSING STREETS (WALKING INSTEAD OF RUNNING/HOPPING, OBSERVING TRAFFIC, USING THE CROSSWALK INSTEAD OF WALKING OUTSIDE THE CROSSWALK, AND KEEPING CLOSE TO AN ACCOMPANYING ADULT) AND THOSE RELATED TO WALKING ALONGSIDE BUSY STREETS (WALKING INSTEAD OF RUNNING/HOPPING ON THE SIDEWALK, NOT PLAYING ON THE SIDEWALK, WALKING ALONE INSTEAD OF WALKING SIDE-BY-SIDE WITH A PARTNER). RESULTS: RESULTS REVEALED THAT AS A WHOLE, BOYS PLAYED ON THE SIDEWALK MORE OFTEN THAN GIRLS (P < 0.01) AND CROSSED WITH AN ACCOMPANYING ADULT MORE THAN GIRLS (P <0.05), WHILE GIRLS WALKED SIDE-BY-SIDE WITH PARTNERS MORE OFTEN THAN BOYS (P <0.05). WITH A FEW EXCEPTIONS, BOYS AND GIRLS IN THE YOUNGER GRADES (1-2) AS WELL AS THOSE IN THE OLDER GRADES (5-6) BEHAVED FAIRLY SIMILARLY AS PEDESTRIANS, BUT BOYS AND GIRLS IN THE MIDDLE GRADES (3-4) PRESENTED WITH SEVERAL SIGNIFICANT GENDER-BASED DIFFERENCES. IN THE MIDDLE GRADES, BOYS WATCHED TRAFFIC MORE THAN GIRLS WHILE CROSSING (P <0.01); RAN, HOPPED AND PLAYED ON THE SIDEWALK MORE OFTEN THAN GIRLS (P <0.05); AND WALKED SIDE-BY-SIDE LESS OFTEN WITH PARTNERS THAN GIRLS (P <0.05). WE ALSO DETECTED DIFFERENT GENDER -BASED TRENDS IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF PEDESTRIAN SKILLS. WITH INCREASING AGE, GIRLS PERFORMED MORE SAFELY IN PEDESTRIAN TASKS, BUT BOYS DID NOT SHOW A SIMILAR DEVELOPMENTAL TREND. CONCLUSIONS: WE CONCLUDE THAT BOYS AND GIRLS EXHIBIT DIFFERENT CHARACTERISTICS IN THEIR PEDESTRIAN BEHAVIORS AND DISCUSS IMPLICATIONS FOR PREVENTION.

THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN HELMET USE AND CYCLING SPEED UNDER NATURALISTIC CONDITIONS	JOURNAL OF SAFETY RESEARCH	INTRODUCTION: AN ARGUMENT AGAINST MANDATORY HELMET USE IS BASED ON THE IDEA OF RISK COMPENSATION, WHICH MEANS THAT CYCLISTS MIGHT RIDE FASTER WHEN WEARING A HELMET (LARDELLI-CLARET ET AL., 2003). HOWEVER, QUESTIONNAIRE AND EXPERIMENTAL STUDIES WERE UNABLE TO FIND EVIDENCE FOR THIS ASSUMPTION (FYHRI ET AL., 2012; FYHRI & PHILIPPS, 2013). SIMULTANEOUSLY, OTHER FACTORS WITH A POTENTIAL ROLE IN HELMET USE AND CYCLING SPEED, SUCH AS TRIP LENGTH AND RIDER CHARACTERISTICS HAVE BEEN NEGLECTED IN SUCH CONSIDERATIONS. THE GOAL OF THE ANALYSIS PRESENTED IN THIS PAPER WAS THEREFORE TO INVESTIGATE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN HELMET USE AND CYDING SPEED UNDER NATURALISTIC CONDITIONS WHILE TAKING CHARACTERISTICS OF CYCLISTS AND BICYCLES INTO ACCOUNT. METHOD: AS PART OF A NATURALISTIC CYCLING STUDY, WE EQUIPPED THE BICYCLES OF CONVENTIONAL AND E-BIKE RIDERS WITH DATA ACQUISITION SYSTEMS TO RECORD SPEED AND TRIP DISTANCE. IT INCLUDED TWO CAMERAS (ONE FOR THE FACE OF THE PARTICIPANT, ANOTHER ONE FOR THE FORWARD SCENERY). FOR THE ANALYSIS PRESENTED IN THIS PAPER, WE USED THE DATA OF 76 PARTICIPANTS (28 CONVENTIONAL BICYCLES, 48 E-BIKES). RESULTS: IN TOTAL, PARTICIPANTS USED THEIR HELMET FOR 56% OF ALL TRIPS. HELMETS WERE USED MORE FREQUENTLY FOR LONGER TRIPS. A LINEAR MIXED MODEL, IN WHICH TRIP LENGTH, HELMET USE, BICYCLE TYPE, AGE, AND GENDER WERE USED AS PREDICTORS SHOWED THAT HELMET USE DID NOT PLAY A SIGNIFICANT ROLE FOR CYCLING SPEED. INSTEAD, ALL OTHER FACTORS THAT WERE ANALYZED, WITH THE EXCEPTION OF GENDER, HAD A SIGNIFICANT RELATIONSHIP TO CYCLING SPEED. DISCUSSION: THE ASSUMPTION OF RISK COMPENSATION AS A RESULT OF THE USE OF A HELMET COULD NOT BE CONFIRMED. INSTEAD, THE FINDINGS SEEM TO SUPPORT THE SUGGESTION THAT CYCLISTS WHO UNDERTAKE TRIPS AT POTENTIALLY HIGHER SPEED LEVELS ARE AWARE OF THEIR INCREASED RISK, AND ACTIVELY TRY TO REDUCE IT THROUGH THE USE OF A HELMET.

THE UNDERLYING LOGIC BEHIND THE GROUP LENDING MODEL IS THAT THE PROVISION OF SMALL LOANS FOR POOR WOMEN, IN PARTICULAR, COULD FACILITATE SOCIO-ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND LIVELIHOOD IMPROVEMENT IN THE RURAL AREAS. MICROCREDIT TO WOMEN IS CONSIDERED AS A TOOL FOR EMPOWERING WOMEN WITH INCREASED SELF-ESTEEM, DECISIONMAKING CAPABILITY AND NEW INCOME-EARNING OPPORTUNITIES. HOWEVER, THE IMPACT OF MICROCREDIT ON MARGINALIZED PEOPLE REMAINS DEBATED. WHILE THE POSITIVE IMPACT OF MICROCREDIT ON MILLIONS OF POOR PEOPLE'S LIVES HAS BEEN DOCUMENTED BY VARIOUS STUDIES, THERE ARE ALSO STUDIES THAT CHALLENGE THE ARGUMENTS ABOUT WOMEN EMPOWERMENT THROUGH MICROCREDIT INVOLVEMENT. BASED ON INTERVIEWS WITH 175 OF ECONOMICALLY AND SOCIALLY VULNERABLE FEMALE MICROCREDIT BORROWERS, THE PRESENT STUDY CONTRIBUTES TO THE CONTINUING DEBATE OVER HOW OR IF MICROCREDIT INTERVENTION ENHANCES WOMEN'S CAPABILITIES IN ACHIEVING HEALTH CARE UTILIZATION, FOOD AND NUTRITION SECURITY, AND PERSONAL FREEDOM AT THE LOCAL LEVEL IN BANGLADESH. INDICES WERE DEVELOPED TO QUANTIFY THE CAPABILITIES OF WOMEN. TO MEASURE DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF CAPABILITIES, VARIABLES WERE ANALYZED THROUGH UNIVARIATE AND BI-VARIATE ANALYSES.

THIS STUDY SOUGHT TO UNDERSTAND THE SHARE DISTRIBUTION AND INCIDENCE OF STAY AT HOME WOMEN WITH DIFFERENT LEVELS OF EDUCATION ATTAINMENT AND TO IDENTIFY REASONS FOR NON-PARTICIPATION. THE ANALYSIS WAS BASED ON QUANTITATIVE DATA FROM THE 2014 LABOR FORCE SURVEY AND 2012/13 HOUSEHOLD INCOME AND EXPENDITURE SURVEYS OF THE DEPARTMENT OF CENSUS AND STATISTICS, AND ON QUALITATIVE DATA COLLECTED FROM INTERVIEWS WITH LABOR MARKET EXPERTS. QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS SHOWS THAT THE LARGEST SHARE AND THE HIGHEST INCIDENCE OF WORKING AGE WOMEN WHO DO NOT PARTICIPATE IN THE LABOUR FORCE ARE UPPER SECONDARY SCHOOL DROPOUTS. THE LOWEST SHARE AND INCIDENCE ARE AMONG THOSE WITH TERTIARY EDUCATION. THOUGH THE SHARE OF STAY AT HOME WOMEN WITH LOWER EDUCATION WAS LOW, INCIDENCE WAS HIGH. IRRESPECTIVE OF EDUCATIONAL ATTAINMENT, BEING MARRIED AND HAVING A HOUSEHOLD INCOME WERE SIGNIFICANT FACTORS EXPLAINING NON-PARTICIPATION IN THE LABOR FORCE. LABOUR FORCE PARTICIPATION OF THE TERTIARY EDUCATED WOMEN WAS NOT AFFECTED BY MATERNAL STATUS, ETHNO RELIGIOUS IDENTITY OR LABOR MARKET FACTORS. THE QUALITATIVE DATA SUGGESTS THE IMPORTANT ROLE OF RESERVATION WAGES IN THE LABOR FORCE PARTICIPATION DECISION OF UPPER SECONDARY SCHOOL DROPOUTS. THE ABSENCE OF SOFT AND HARD SKILLS REQUIRED TO ACCESS JOBS, MEETING THEIR RESERVATION WAGE LEVELS AND THE ABSENCE OF EMPLOYMENT GUIDANCE TEND TO IMPEDE THEIR PARTICIPATION IN THE LABOR FORCE.

IT PORTRAYS CELEBRITY FATHERS TAKING CARE OF THEIR YOUNG CHILDREN, UNASSISTED, FOR 48 HOURS, WHILE THEIR WIVES ARE TAKING A RELAXING BREAK. THE NARRATIVE REVOLVES AROUND THE EXPERIENCES OF CLUMSY FATHERS WHO KNOW VERY LITTLE ABOUT CHILDCARE. USING AN AUDIENCE ANALYSIS, WE INVESTIGATE HOW BOTH MEN AND WOMEN REACT TO GENDER ROLES AS PORTRAYED IN THE RETURN OF SUPERMAN, AND EXAMINE HOW THEIR INTERPRETATION OF THE SHOW IS RELATED TO THE PROGRESSIVE POTENTIAL OF MALE CHILDCARE REALITY SHOWS. WE ARGUE THAT IT IS PREMATURE TO PRESUME THAT THE POPULARITY OF THIS SHOW INDICATES GENDER EQUALITY, CONSIDERING THAT BOTH MALE AND FEMALE VIEWERS ARE SKEPTICAL OF THE SHOW'S PORTRAYAL OF REALITY, AND THUS ARE NOT HOPEFUL ABOUT THE FEASIBILITY OF ACHIEVING GENDER EQUALITY IN REGARD TO HOUSEWORK IN THEIR OWN EVERYDAY LIVES.

CREATING DEMAND FOR ABORTION SERVICE: A CONTENT ANALYSIS OF ONLINE ADVERTISING VIDEOS FOR ABORTION CARE IN MAINLAND CHINA	ASIAN WOMEN	THIS STUDY EXAMINES HOW ONLINE ADVERTISEMENTS USE FEAR APPEALS TO PROMOTE ABORTION SERVICES AMONG CHINESE WOMEN. USING A QUANTITATIVE CONTENT ANALYSIS, WE IDENTIFIED VARIOUS EMOTIONAL APPEALS, AS WELL AS THE FOUR CONSTRUCTS OF THE EXTENDED PARALLEL PROCESS MODEL ADOPTED IN 159 CHINESE ONLINE ADVERTISING VIDEOS PROMOTING ABORTION SERVICES. WE FOUND THAT 83.0% OF ADS USED EMOTIONAL APPEALS, WHILE THE EMOTION OF FEAR WAS ADDRESSED MOST FREQUENTLY (73.0%); 98.7% OF ADS INCLUDED SELF-EFFICACY INFORMATION AND RESPONSE EFFICACY INFORMATION, FOLLOWED BY SUSCEPTIBILITY MESSAGES (81.8%); AND SEVERITY MESSAGES WERE THE LEAST LIKELY TO BE MENTIONED (73.6%). BASED ON THESE FINDINGS, WE CONCLUDE THAT CHINESE ONLINE ABORTION ADS RELY MOST HEAVILY ON FEAR APPEALS RATHER THAN OTHER TYPES OF EMOTIONAL APPEALS. THESE FEAR-RELATED MESSAGES OVERSELL THE BENEFITS OF ABORTION SERVICES AND MEDICALIZE THE EXPERIENCE OF UNPLANNED PREGNANCY, PRESENTING ABORTION AS A SOLUTION FOR CHINESE WOMEN WITH UNPLANNED PREGNANCIES.

THE POPULATION OF INTEREST CONSISTED OF ALL MEMBERS OF RURAL WOMEN'S COOPERATIVES OF URMIA COUNTY, IRAN. USING KREJCIE AND MORGAN'S TABLE AND FOLLOWING A SIMPLE RANDOM SAMPLING METHOD, 152 INDIVIDUALS WERE SELECTED AS THE RESEARCH SAMPLE. A QUESTIONNAIRE WAS THE MAIN TOOL FOR DATA GATHERING, STRUCTURED ON THE READINESS, ACTION, AND IMPACT (RAI) COMMUNICATION MODEL. THE VALIDITY OF THE QUESTIONNAIRE WAS VERIFIED BY A PANEL OF EXPERTS. TO ASSESS ITS RELIABILITY, CRONBACH'S ALPHA COEFFICIENT WAS CALCULATED FOR THE MAIN SCALES OF THE QUESTIONNAIRE (A = 0.76 TO 0.90). INTERVIEW WAS ALSO USED AS A COMPLEMENTARY INSTRUMENT TO COLLECT DATA. RESULTS SHOWED THAT RURAL WOMEN HAD NO FAVORABLE VIEW TOWARD READINESS, RELATED ACTIVITIES, AND THE IMPACTS OF ICT ON THEIR EMPOWERMENT. APPARENTLY, MEMBERS OF THE RURAL WOMEN'S COOPERATIVES ARE STUCK AT THE READINESS LEVEL. CONSEQUENTLY, THEY LOSE MANY OPPORTUNITIES THAT MAKE COOPERATIVES MORE FRUITFUL OVER TIME. IF THEY COULD GET BETTER ACCESS TO ICT INSTRUMENTS, ONE CAN HOPE THAT POSITIVE STEPS WOULD BE TAKEN TO OTHER LEVELS I.E., ACTIVITY AND IMPACT.

IN RESPONSE TO SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES, THE ASSIMILATION EXPERIENCE OF LGBTQ AMERICANS FACILITATES THEIR MANIFESTATION OF THE BLEACHING SYNDROME.

IN ADDITION TO ADAPTING THE GAMEPLAY, EDUCATIONAL GAMES SHOULD ALSO ADAPT THE LEARNING CONTENT TO MATCH THE LEARNER'S COMPETENCIES, PREFERENCES, PLAYING AND LEARNING STYLES. DETERMINING THE PLAYING STYLE IN AN EDUCATIONAL GAME IS MADE POSSIBLE BY COLLECTING CERTAIN METRICS AND INFORMATION SUSCEPTIBLE OF MONITORING THE PLAYER'S INTERACTIONS IN THE GAME. HOWEVER, IT IS STILL A CHALLENGE TO ASSESS THE LEARNER'S LEARNING STYLE. AIM: THIS STUDY EXAMINES THE CORRELATION BETWEEN LEARNING AND PLAYING STYLES. IT HAS BEEN ACKNOWLEDGED THAT BOTH PLAYING AND LEARNING STYLES ARE RELATED TO PERSONALITY. AFTER EXAMINING THE PERSONALITY TRAITS OF EACH STYLE OF BOTH KOLB'S LEARNING STYLES AND BARTLE'S PLAYING STYLES, IT WAS HYPOTHESIZED THAT THERE WOULD BE A CORRELATION BETWEEN THE TWO.

METHOD: ONE HUNDRED HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS MAJORING IN SCIENCE IN MOROCCO HAVE COMPLETED KOLB'S LEARNING STYLE INVENTORY (VERSION 3.1) AS WELL AS THE BARTLE TEST QUESTIONNAIRE DEVELOPED BY ANDREASEN AND DOWNEY. THE STATISTICAL CORRELATION BETWEEN THE TWO TAXONOMIES WAS INVESTIGATED USING CROSS-TABULATION, CHI-SQUARE/FISHER'S EXACT TEST AND PEARSON COEFFICIENT. RESULTS: RESULTS REVEALED A RELEVANT INTERDEPENDENCY BETWEEN KOLB'S LEARNING STYLES AND BARTLE'S PLAYING STYLES. THE 'CONVERGENT' TYPE WAS FOUND TO CORRELATE WITH BARTLE'S EXPLORER TYPE; THE MAJORITY OF ASSIMILATORS ADOPT THE KILLER TYPE IN A GAME; ACCOMODATORS TEND TO BE ACHIEVERS AND DIVERGERS PREFER TO BE SOCIALIZERS. IN TERMS OF LEARNING STYLES, IT WAS NOTICED THAT THE MAJORITY OF PARTICIPANTS ADOPTED THE CONVERGING AND THE ASSIMILATING LEARNING STYLES; WHICH IS IN LINE WITH WHAT IT IS INDICATED IN KOLB'S INVENTORY.

A LARGE REPRESENTATIVE SAMPLE OF ACTIVE-DUTY FEMALE AIR FORCE PERSONNEL, WHO RESPONDED TO THE U.S. AIR FORCE COMMUNITY ASSESSMENT SURVEY (CAS), WAS USED TO DETERMINE THE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN WARTIME EXPERIENCES AND SYMPTOMS OF PTSD. PREVIOUS RESEARCH SUGGESTS THE POSSIBILITY THAT FACTORS, INCLUDING UNIT COHESION AND SELF-EFFICACY, MAY MEDIATE THESE RELATIONS. RESULTS: DESCRIPTIVE ANALYSES INDICATE THAT THE PERCENTAGE OF PERSONNEL EXPERIENCING PTSD SYMPTOMS INCREASED AS THE NUMBER OF WARTIME EXPERIENCES INCREASED. LOGISTIC REGRESSION ANALYSES REVEALED THAT WARTIME EXPERIENCES WERE POSITIVELY RELATED TO SUBSEQUENT PTSD-RELATED SYMPTOMS. BOTH UNIT COHESION AND SELF-EFFICACY WERE NEGATIVELY RELATED TO PTSD SYMPTOMS, BUT NEITHER VARIABLE WAS FOUND TO MODERATE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN WARTIME EXPERIENCES AND PTSD. CONCLUSIONS: WOMEN ARE EXPERIENCING GREATER NUMBERS OF WARTIME EXPERIENCES. LIKE MEN, AS THE NUMBER OF WARTIME EXPERIENCES INCREASES, PTSD SYMPTOMS INCREASE AS WELL. SELF-EFFICACY AND UNIT COHESION WERE FOUND TO LOWER THESE SYMPTOMS, INDICATING THAT THESE FACTORS MAY HELP DECREASE THE NEGATIVE IMPACT OF WARTIME EXPERIENCES.

METHODS: WE SENT AN ANONYMOUS ONLINE SURVEY TO RANDOMLY SELECTED MEMBERS OF THE AMERICAN CONGRESS OF OBSTETRICIANS AND GYNECOLOGISTS AND STRATIFIED RESPONSES BY THE HISTORY OF TRAINING. WE USED LOGISTIC REGRESSION TO PREDICT IMPACT OF PREVIOUS TRAINING ON PROVIDER COMFORT WITH LGB-TGNC PATIENTS, AND SECONDARY OUTCOMES, INCLUDING PROVIDER PRACTICES, KNOWLEDGE, AND ATTITUDES. RESULTS: TWO HUNDRED TWENTY-EIGHT OF 428 (53.3%) SURVEYS WERE COMPLETED. OF THE 169 PROVIDERS CURRENTLY PRACTICING GYNECOLOGY, 72 RESPONDENTS (42.6%) REPORTED PREVIOUS TRAINING IN LGB-TGNC HEALTH. THOSE WHO SELF-IDENTIFIED OR HAD A CLOSE CONTACT IDENTIFYING AS LGB-TGNC WERE MORE LIKELY TO REPORT PREVIOUS TRAINING (68.1% VS. 49.5%, P = 0.02). WHEN ADJUSTING FOR DEMOGRAPHIC DIFFERENCES, PROVIDERS REPORTING PREVIOUS TRAINING WERE NOT MORE LIKELY TO BE COMFORTABLE TAKING CARE OF TRANSGENDER/GENDER-NONCONFORMING PATIENTS (AOR 1.8, 95% CI 0.95-3.40). THEY WERE MORE LIKELY TO REPORT PRACTICE CHANGES SUCH AS ELICITING SEXUAL ORIENTATION (AOR 2.15, 95% CI 1.08-4.28) AND GENDER IDENTITY (AOR 3.02, 95% CI 1.07-8.52). TRAINING WAS NOT INDEPENDENTLY ASSOCIATED WITH DIFFERENCES IN PROVIDER KNOWLEDGE (AOR 1.33, 95% CI 0.68-2.58) OR LIKELIHOOD OF PROVIDING INDEPENDENT MEDICAL OR SURGICAL CARE FOR GENDER AFFIRMATION (AOR 1.64, 95% CI 0.78-3.45). CONCLUSIONS: LESS THAN HALF OF BOARD-CERTIFIED OBSTETRICIAN-GYNECOLOGISTS REPORTED TRAINING IN LGB-TGNC HEALTH, WITH EVIDENCE OF A FAMILIARITY EFFECT IN WHO SEEKS TRAINING AND PROVIDES CARE THAT ACCOUNTS FOR DIFFERENCES IN ATTITUDES, KNOWLEDGE, AND PRACTICES.

MEDICARE UTILIZATION AND SPENDING AMONG NURSES COMPARED WITH THE GENERAL UNITED STATES POPULATION	JOURNAL OF WOMENS HEALTH	BACKGROUND: TO BETTER UNDERSTAND HEALTH HABITS IN OLDER NURSES VERSUS THE GENERAL POPULATION, WE SOUGHT TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE DEMOGRAPHICS, HEALTH CARE UTILIZATION, AND MEDICARE SPENDING BY THE NURSES' HEALTH STUDY (NHS) PARTICIPANTS ENROLLED IN MEDICARE AND A MATCHED SAMPLE OF MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES MEANINGFULLY DIFFERED. MATERIALS AND METHODS: ANALYTIC COHORTS INCLUDED A RANDOM 20% SAMPLE OF MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES CONTINUOUSLY ENROLLED IN FEE FOR SERVICE (FFS) MEDICARE THAT WERE PROPENSITY MATCHED TO THE NHS PARTICIPANTS CONTINUOUSLY ENROLLED IN FFS MEDICARE IN A SINGLE YEAR (2012). MATCHING WAS BASED UPON PRESELECTED DEMOGRAPHIC FACTORS AND HEALTH STATUS, USING A NEAREST-NEIGHBOR MATCHING ALGORITHM TO OBTAIN A 1:1 MATCH WITHOUT REPLACEMENT. HEALTHCARE UTILIZATION AND SPENDING WERE COMPARED BETWEEN THE TWO GROUPS; WE ALSO STRATIFIED FINDINGS BY NUMBER OF CHRONIC COMORBIDITIES. RESULTS: SIMILAR RATES OF UTILIZATION OF PRIMARY CARE AND MOST OUTPATIENT SERVICES. HOWEVER, NHS PARTICIPANTS HAD SLIGHTLY HIGHER RATES OF CANCER SCREENING, SPECIALIST CARE, AND INPATIENT SURGERY WERE OBSERVED. WHEN STRATIFIED BY COMORBIDITY STATUS, THE LARGEST DIFFERENCES IN UTILIZATION AND SPENDING WERE FOUND IN WOMEN WITH NO COMORBIDITY. CONCLUSIONS: THE MODEST DIFFERENCES IN OBSERVED HEALTHCARE UTILIZATION AND SPENDING SUGGEST THAT OLDER HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONALS MAY ACCESS CARE IN FAIRLY SIMILAR WAYS TO THE GENERAL POPULATION, AND THAT HEALTH STATUS MAY BE A MORE IMPORTANT DETERMINANT OF UTILIZATION AND SPENDING THAN HEALTH PROFESSION IN OLDER AGE GROUPS.

WE INVESTIGATED THE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN MIGRAINE AND BREAST CANCER INCIDENCE IN A NATIONWIDE POPULATION-BASED COHORT STUDY. METHODS: WE IDENTIFIED 25,606 WOMEN WITH MIGRAINE BETWEEN 2000 AND 2013 FROM THE NATIONAL HEALTH INSURANCE RESEARCH DATABASE IN TAIWAN. EACH MIGRAINEUR WAS RANDOMLY FREQUENCY MATCHED WITH FOUR WOMEN WITHOUT MIGRAINE BY AGE AND INDEX YEAR OF MIGRAINE DIAGNOSIS. COX'S PROPORTIONAL HAZARD REGRESSION ANALYSIS WAS PERFORMED TO ESTIMATE THE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN MIGRAINE ON THE RISK OF DEVELOPING BREAST CANCER. RESULTS: WITH A MEAN FOLLOW-UP OF 7.3 YEARS, 234 AND 978 BREAST MALIGNANCIES OCCURRED IN THE MIGRAINE COHORT AND MATCHED COHORT, RESPECTIVELY. MIGRAINE WAS NOT ASSOCIATED WITH THE RISK OF BREAST CANCER (ADJUSTED HAZARD RATIO = 1.03, 95% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL = 0.89-1.21). AMONG WOMEN WITH MIGRAINE, INDEPENDENT RISK FACTORS FOR BREAST CANCER INCLUDED OLDER AGE, ALCOHOL-RELATED ILLNESS, AND RECEIPT OF A GREATER NUMBER OF BREAST CANCER SCREENING EXAMINATIONS, AND INDEPENDENT PROTECTIVE FACTORS INCLUDED THE USE OF ANTIHYPERTENSIVE AGENTS, STATINS, AND NONSTEROIDAL ANTI-INFLAMMATORY DRUGS. FURTHER ANALYSES INDICATED THAT WOMEN WITH >= 4 MEDICAL VISITS FOR MIGRAINE PER YEAR HAD A SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER RISK OF BREAST CANCER THAN THE MATCHED COHORT. CONCLUSIONS: MIGRAINE WAS NOT ASSOCIATED WITH A DECREASED RISK OF DEVELOPING BREAST CANCER AMONG TAIWANESE WOMEN. FURTHER PROSPECTIVE STUDIES ON OTHER GEOGRAPHIC POPULATIONS OR ON THE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN MIGRAINE FREQUENCY AND THE RISK OF DEVELOPING BREAST CANCER ARE WARRANTED TO VALIDATE OUR FINDINGS.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: THE STUDY INCLUDED 149 PATIENTS WITH POI AND 303 CONTROL WOMEN WITHOUT POI. AGE, BODY MASS INDEX (BMI), GESTATIONAL HISTORY, TIME SINCE ONSET OF POI, AND STATUS OF HORMONE THERAPY (HT) FOR POI WERE RECORDED. RESULTS: THERE WAS NO STATISTICAL DIFFERENCE IN THE MEAN AGE, BMI, AND PARITY BETWEEN THE TWO GROUPS. THE PREVALENCE OF SUI IN THE POI GROUP TENDED TO BE HIGHER THAN THAT IN THE CONTROL GROUP (20.9%, 30/149 VS. 16.2%, 49/303), ALTHOUGH NOT SIGNIFICANTLY (P = 0.297). ABOUT 41.6% (62/149) OF PATIENTS WITH POI RECEIVED HT. PATIENTS WITH POI AND SUI WERE OLDER (P = 0.018) AND HAD HIGHER BMI (P = 0.007) THAN WOMEN WITH POI WITHOUT SUI (P = 0.007). COMPARED TO NULLIPARAS, PRIMIPARAS WERE MORE LIKELY TO HAVE SUI (P = 0.046). HOWEVER, SUI DEVELOPED IRRESPECTIVE OF TIME SINCE ONSET OF OLIGOMENORRHEA/AMENORRHEA OR HT USE. FURTHERMORE, REGRESSION ANALYSIS SHOWED THAT THE PREVALENCE OF SUI WAS HIGHER IN WOMEN 30-39 YEARS OF AGE (ODDS RATIO [OR] = 3.27, P = 0.002) AND OLDER THAN 40 YEARS (OR = 7.78, P = 0.001). PRIMIPARAS (OR = 2.89, P = 0.001) AND VAGINAL DELIVERY (OR = 2.58, P = 0.023) WERE ASSOCIATED WITH SUI. CONCLUSIONS: THE PREVALENCE OF SUI WAS FAIRLY HIGH AMONG PATIENTS WITH POI, AND AGE, PARITY, AND VAGINAL DELIVERY WERE THE MAIN RISK FACTORS. HOWEVER, DURATION OF POI AND HT USE HAD NO EFFECT ON SUI.

OBJECTIVES: THE PRESENT STUDY ANALYSES RECALLED PARENTAL CHILD-REARING ATTITUDES AND BEHAVIOR AND QUALITY OF RELATIONSHIPS WITHIN THE FAMILIES OF TRANSGENDER PERSONS. METHODS: THE SAMPLE CONSISTS OF 99 SUBJECTS OF WHOM 46 PARTICIPANTS IDENTIFIED AS TRANSGENDER. THE REMAINING 53 PERSONS WERE ALLOCATED TO THE CISGENDER CONTROL GROUP. THE QUESTIONNAIRE USED TO RECORD THE REMEMBERED PARENTAL BEHAVIOR WAS THE QUESTIONNAIRE ON PARENTAL ATTITUDES AND REARING PRACTICES (FEPS), WHICH REPRESENTS AN EXTENDED VERSION OF THE PARENTAL BONDING INSTRUMENT. THE RELATIONSHIP-CONTEXT- SCALE (BKS) WAS USED TO MEASURE THE QUALITY OF RELATIONSHIPS WITHIN THE FAMILIES. ADDITIONALLY, THE FEPS VALUES OF THE GROUP CONSISTING OF TRANSGENDER PERSONS WAS COMPARED TO THOSE OF AN INTERSEX SAMPLE (N = 37). RESULTS: TRANSGENDER PERSONS RATED BOTH OF THEIR PARENTS AS BEING LESS CARING AND LESS SUPPORTIVE IN TERMS OF AUTONOMY THAN DID PERSONS OF THE COMPARISON GROUP. ADDITIONALLY, THE FATHER IS RATED AS BEING MORE PUNITIVE. THE INTERPERSONAL RELATIONSHIPS WITHIN THE FAMILY WERE ASSESSED AS BEING AT A LOWER LEVEL WITH REGARD TO RELATIONSHIP-REPRESENTATIONS. THE REPORTS OF THE GROUP OF TRANSGENDER INDIVIDUALS SHOWED A HIGHER LIKELIHOOD OF THEIR PARENTS BREAKING UP. THE INTERSEX SAMPLE ASSESSED THEIR MOTHERS AS WELL AS THEIR FATHERS AS BEING LESS CARING AND LESS SUPPORTIVE OF THEIR AUTONOMY COMPARED TO THE TRANSGENDER GROUP. FURTHERMORE, THE PARENTS ARE REMEMBERED AS BEING MORE PUNITIVE AND MORE LIKELY TO REWARD MATERIALLY. CONCLUSION: THE RESULTS UNDERLINE THE SUPPOSITION THAT THE PARENT-CHILD-RELATIONSHIP CAN BE FOUND TO BE SUBJECT TO CONSIDERABLE STRAIN IN THE CASE OF TRANSGENDER INDIVIDUALS AS WELL AS INTERSEX INDIVIDUALS.

METHODS: THE SCHOOLBOOKS WERE EXAMINED AND COMPARED BY MEANS OF STRUCTURE-GIVING QUALITATIVE CONTENT ANALYSIS. RESULTS: THE RESULTS SHOW THAT PARTS OF THE DECREE IN LOWER SAXONY HAVE BEEN IMPLEMENTED. IT APPEARS THAT ADOLESCENTS ARE IN PART SUPPORTED IN THEIR SEXUAL AND GENDER DEVELOPMENT, BUT THE RESULTS DIFFER IN TERMS OF QUALITY: THE TWO BOOK SERIES SHOWED A SHIFT TOWARDS INCLUSION REGARDING SEXUAL ORIENTATION, HOWEVER, INTERSEXUALITY AND TRANS IDENTITY ARE REPRESENTED ONLY IN BRIEF, IN PART INACCURATELY AND IN CONFLICT WITH OTHER PARTS OF THE BOOKS.

LA INFORMACION FUE RECABADA A TRAVES DE ENTREVISTAS SEMIESTRUCTURADAS REALIZADAS CON 20 MUJERES PROFESIONALES HABITANTES DE HANOI, CUYAS EDADES FLUCTUAN ENTRE LOS 25 Y 40 ANOS. EL ANALISIS TEMATICO REALIZADO POSTERIORMENTE SUGIERE QUE AL ADOPTAR NOCIONES RELATIVAS A LA BUSQUEDA DE PLACER, Y ASPIRANDO A LOGRARLO, MUCHAS MUJERES APUESTAN A LA MODERNIDAD, PROCURANDO PROMOVER LA IDEA DE QUE YA NO RESPONDEN A LOS CANONES TRADICIONALES EN ESTE AMBITO PARTICULAR DE LA VIDA SOCIAL. SIN EMBARGO, EN TANTO EN VIETNAM PERMANECEN FIRMEMENTE ARRAIGADAS FUERZAS SOCIALES MAS AMPLIAS, ASOCIADAS A LA IDEOLOGIA DE GENERO TRADICIONAL Y A LOS VALORES SEXUALES PRESENTES EN EL PAIS, LAS MISMAS INCIDEN EN LA VIDA COTIDIANA DE LAS MUJERES Y EN SUS ROLES DE ESPOSAS Y MADRES TRABAJADORAS. ELLO RETRASA SU BUSQUEDA DE PLACER Y, POR TANTO, LA CONSECUCION DE SU BIENESTAR EN EL SENTIDO MAS AMPLIO DEL TERMINO. DE HECHO, QUIENES PARTICIPARON EN ESTE ESTUDIO INTERPRETAN EL SEXO COMO ALGO ORGANIZADO CASI EXCLUSIVAMENTE ALREDEDOR DEL COITO PENE-VAGINA. AUN CUANDO LAS MUJERES VISUALIZAN EL SEXO COMO ALGO MAS QUE LA PENETRACION, SIGUEN CONSIDERANDO QUE SU COMPONENTE PRINCIPAL ES EL COITO PENE-VAGINA, SIN EL CUAL LA TRANSACCION SEXUAL PARECE SER INCOMPLETA. LA FORMA EN QUE HA SIDO NORMALIZADA LA RELACION SEXUAL CON PENETRACION SE VINCULA A VECES CON EL ESTIGMA Y LA DISCRIMINACION ASOCIADOS A OTRAS PRACTICAS SEXUALES SIN COITO, LO QUE HACE QUE ESTAS MUJERES SE ENCUENTREN FUERTEMENTE POSICIONADAS AL INTERIOR DE DISCURSOS CONVENCIONALES LIGADOS A LA NATURALIDAD Y LA SALUD EN EL AMBITO SEXUAL.

THE SOCIAL CONTEXT OF HORMONE AND SILICONE INJECTION AMONG PUERTO RICAN TRANSWOMEN	CULTURE HEALTH & SEXUALITY	THIS PAPER DRAWS ON ETHNOGRAPHIC, QUALITATIVE AND SURVEY DATA WITH TRANSWOMEN IN PUERTO RICO TO EXAMINE THE SOCIAL AND POLITICAL-ECONOMIC CONTEXT OF LAY INJECTION WITH HORMONE AND SILICONE - COMMON PRACTICES WITHIN THIS COMMUNITY. WE DESCRIBE SPECIFIC PRACTICES OF HORMONE AND SILICONE INJECTION, THE ACTORS THAT GOVERN THEM, THE MARKET FOR THE SALE AND DISTRIBUTION OF SYRINGES AND THE NETWORKS OF LAY SPECIALISTS WHO PROVIDE SERVICES TO A POPULATION THAT IS NEGLECTED BY AND LARGELY EXCLUDED FROM BIOMEDICAL SETTINGS. OUR DATA DERIVE FROM ETHNOGRAPHIC OBSERVATIONS, SOCIODEMOGRAPHIC QUESTIONNAIRES, SURVEYS AND SEMI-STRUCTURED INTERVIEWS CONDUCTED WITH A DIVERSE GROUP OF TRANSWOMEN IN METROPOLITAN SAN JUAN, PUERTO RICO. OUR ANALYSIS FOCUSES ON FOUR OVERLAPPING SOCIAL DOMAINS OR PROCESSES THAT SHAPE THE PRACTICES OF LAY SILICONE AND HORMONE INJECTION AMONG TRANSWOMEN: (1) THE CIRCULATION OF GENDER TRANSITIONING TECHNOLOGIES WITHIN LOCAL AND GLOBAL MARKETS; (2) THE TENSION BETWEEN THE SOCIAL EXCLUSION OF TRANSWOMEN AND THEIR RESILIENT SUB-CULTURAL RESPONSES; (3) THE CULTURAL MEANINGS THAT SHAPE TRANSWOMEN'S ATTITUDES ABOUT INJECTION; AND (4) THE PERCEIVED CONSEQUENCES OF INJECTION. WE CONCLUDE WITH A DISCUSSION OF THE KINDS OF INTERVENTION AND POLICY CHANGES THAT WOULD RESPOND TO THE FACTORS THAT MOST ENDANGER TRANSWOMEN'S HEALTH. RESUMECET ARTICLE UTILISE DES DONNEES ETHNOGRAPHIQUES, QUALITATIVES ET ISSUES D'UNE ENQUETE SUR DES TRANSFEMMES A PORTO-RICO POUR EXAMINER LE CONTEXTE SOCIAL ET POLITICO-ECONOMIQUE DES INJECTIONS D'HORMONES ET DE SILICONE PAR DES PERSONNES PROFANES - UNE PRATIQUE COURANTE AU SEIN DE CETTE COMMUNAUTE. NOUS DECRIVONS DES PRATIQUES PRECISES D'INJECTIONS D'HORMONES ET DE SILICONE, LES PERSONNES QUI LES ASSURENT, LE MARCHE SUR LEQUEL SE VENDENT ET SE DISTRIBUENT LES SERINGUES, ET LES RESEAUX DE SPECIALISTES PROFANES QUI OFFRENT LEURS SERVICES A UNE POPULATION NEGLIGEE PAR LES ENVIRONNEMENTS BIOMEDICAUX ET LARGEMENT EXCLUE DE CES ENVIRONNEMENTS.

NOTRE ANALYSE SE CONCENTRE SUR QUATRE DOMAINES SOCIAUX OU PROCESSUS QUI, SE SUPERPOSANT, DETERMINENT LA PRATIQUE DES INJECTIONS DE SILICONE OU D'HORMONES PAR DES PERSONNES PROFANES, DANS LA COMMUNAUTE DES TRANSFEMMES : (1) LA CIRCULATION DES TECHNOLOGIES RELATIVES AU TRANSGENERISME SUR LES MARCHES LOCAUX ET MONDIAUX ; (2) LA TENSION ENTRE L'EXCLUSION SOCIALE DES TRANSFEMMES ET LEURS REPONSES SOUS-CULTURELLES RESILIENTES ; (3) LES SIGNIFICATIONS CULTURELLES QUI DETERMINENT LES ATTITUDES DES TRANSFEMMES VIS-A-VIS DES INJECTIONS ; ET (4) LES PERCEPTIONS SUR LES CONSEQUENCES DES INJECTIONS. EN CONCLUSION, NOUS DISCUTONS DES TYPES D'INTERVENTIONS ET DES CHANGEMENTS DES POLITIQUES QUI POURRAIENT CONSTITUER DES REPONSES APPROPRIEES AUX FACTEURS DE RISQUE LES PLUS IMPORTANTS POUR LA SANTE DES TRANSFEMMES. RESUMENA PARTIR DE DATOS ETNOGRAFICOS, CUALITATIVOS Y DE ESTUDIOS CON MUJERES TRANSGENERO EN PUERTO RICO, EN ESTE ARTICULO ANALIZAMOS EL CONTEXTO SOCIAL Y POLITICO-ECONOMICO DE LAS PRACTICAS HABITUALES EN ESTA COMUNIDAD DE LA ADMINISTRACION DE INYECCIONES DE HORMONAS Y SILICONA POR PARTE DE PERSONAL NO PROFESIONAL. DESCRIBIMOS QUE PRACTICAS ESPECIFICAS SE SIGUEN EN LA ADMINISTRACION DE INYECCIONES DE HORMONAS Y SILICONA, QUIENES SON LOS PARTICIPANTES QUE LAS REGULAN, CUAL ES EL MERCADO PARA LA VENTA Y DISTRIBUCION DE JERINGAS, Y CUALES SON LAS REDES DE ESPECIALISTAS NO PROFESIONALES QUE OFRECEN SERVICIOS A UNA POBLACION DESATENDIDA Y EXCLUIDA EN GRAN MEDIDA POR ENTORNOS BIOMEDICOS. NUESTROS DATOS PROCEDEN DE OBSERVACIONES ETNOGRAFICAS, CUESTIONARIOS SOCIODEMOGRAFICOS, ESTUDIOS Y ENTREVISTAS SEMIESTRUCTURADAS LLEVADAS A CABO CON UN GRUPO VARIADO DE MUJERES TRANSGENERO EN EL AREA METROPOLITANA DE SAN JUAN, PUERTO RICO. EN EL ANALISIS PRESTAMOS ATENCION A CUATRO DOMINIOS O PROCESOS SOCIALES SOLAPADOS QUE DAN FORMA A LAS PRACTICAS DE ADMINISTRAR INYECCIONES DE SILICONA Y HORMONAS A MUJERES TRANSGENERO: (1) LA CIRCULACION DE TECNOLOGIAS PARA LA TRANSICION DE GENERO EN LOS MERCADOS LOCALES E INTERNACIONALES; (2) LA TENSION ENTRE LA EXCLUSION SOCIAL DE LAS MUJERES TRANSGENERO Y SUS RESPUESTAS SUBCULTURALES RESILIENTES; (3) LOS SIGNIFICADOS CULTURALES QUE DEFINEN LAS ACTITUDES DE LAS MUJERES TRANSGENERO SOBRE LAS INYECCIONES; Y (4) LAS CONSECUENCIAS PERCIBIDAS DE LAS INYECCIONES. CONCLUIMOS CON UN DEBATE SOBRE LOS TIPOS DE INTERVENCIONES Y LOS CAMBIOS POLITICOS QUE RESPONDERIAN A LOS FACTORES QUE MAS PONEN EN PELIGRO LA SALUD DE LAS MUJERES TRANSGENERO.

MATERIAL: 742 STUDENTS WHO WERE SELECTED ACCORDING TO THE RANDOM SAMPLING METHOD FROM 24 SCHOOLS DETERMINED IN THE CITIES AND RURAL AREAS IN ALL REGIONS WERE INCLUDED IN THE STUDY (N = 347 GIRLS, N = 395-BOYS). VOLUNTEERING STUDENTS WHO DID NOT HAVE ANY ACUTE OR CHRONIC DISEASE THAT MIGHT AVOID TESTING WERE INCLUDED IN THE STUDY AFTER THE PERMISSIONS WERE RECEIVED FROM THE MINISTRY OF NATIONAL EDUCATION, PRINCIPALS OF THE SCHOOLS, AND THE SUPPORT OF THE PARENTS. THE DECLARATIONS OF HELSINKI WERE TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION IN THE STUDY. RESULTS: THE RESULTS OF EACH TEST WERE GIVEN AS THE NORM VALUES ACCORDING TO GENDER AND AGE TOGETHER WITH 20% GROUPS, WHICH IS CONSIDERED AS THE CANADIAN STANDARD. THE DATA ON THE PHYSICAL AND BIOMOTORIC CHARACTERISTICS OF THE CHILDREN LIVING IN KOSOVO WERE COMPARED WITH THE DATA OF THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION AND THE LITERATURE DATA OF OTHER COUNTRIES. CONCLUSIONS: WHILE THE CHILDREN LIVING IN KOSOVO SHOWED HIGHER PERFORMANCES IN THE TESTS THAT WERE AFFECTED BY ANTHROPOMETRIC PROPERTIES LIKE HEIGHT AND BODY FAT PERCENTAGE AND BY GENETIC PROPERTIES LIKE THE SPEED OF THE MOVEMENTS OF THE ARMS WHEN COMPARED WITH THE CHILDREN FROM OTHER COUNTRIES FROM THE SAME AGE GROUP; THEY HAD LOWER PERFORMANCES IN THE TESTS THAT WERE AFFECTED BY LIFE STYLE AND PHYSICAL ACTIVITY LEVELS LIKE ENDURANCE, LONG JUMP, AND FLEXIBILITY.

ISI000431108900006	GIACCIO, VINCENZO; GIANNELLI, AGOSTINO; MASTRONARDI, LUIGI	EXPLAINING DETERMINANTS OF AGRI-TOURISM INCOME: EVIDENCE FROM ITALY	TOURISM REVIEW	PURPOSE - THE PURPOSE OF THIS PAPER IS TO ANALYZE THE INCOME SOURCES OF ITALIAN FARM TOURISM BUSINESSES, CONSIDERING SOME ECONOMIC, SOCIAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL VARIABLES THAT REPRESENT INTERNAL BUSINESS FACTORS AND HIGHLIGHTING THEIR CONTRIBUTION TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF THIS INCOME. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH - THE EMPIRICAL ANALYSIS IS BASED ON THE ITALIAN SECTION OF THE FARM ACCOUNTANCY DATA NETWORK (FADN) THAT INCLUDES 365 ITALIAN FARM TOURISM BUSINESSES. FADN IS AN INSTRUMENT TO ASSESS THE INCOME OF EUROPEAN AGRICULTURAL HOLDINGS AND THE IMPACTS OF THE COMMON AGRICULTURAL POLICY. THE ANALYSIS HAS BEEN CARRIED OUT THROUGH A MULTIVARIATE REGRESSION MODEL. FINDINGS - THE RESULTS OF THIS PAPER HAVE SHOWED THAT SOME ECONOMIC VARIABLES (FOOD SERVICE, DIRECT SELLING AND PUBLIC SUBSIDIES) DETERMINE AN INCREASE IN FARM INCOME, WHEREAS AN INCREASED NUMBER OF FAMILY EMPLOYEES MAY HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON THIS INCOME. RESEARCH LIMITATIONS/IMPLICATIONS - EXTERNAL FACTORS, SUCH AS PROXIMITY TO URBAN OR CULTURAL CENTRES, MAY IMPACT ON AGRI-TOURISM INCOME, BUT THESE ARE NOT CONSIDERED IN THE STATISTICAL ANALYSES. ANOTHER LIMIT OF THIS PAPER IS THE EXCLUSION OF TOURISTS' MOTIVATIONAL VARIABLES AND OTHERS MOSTLY REFERRING TO THE MARKET (PRICING POLICIES, PROMOTIONAL STRATEGIES, ETC.). FURTHERMORE, THIS PAPER FOCUSES ON A SPECIFIC COUNTRY AND THIS COULD REDUCE THE GENERALIZATION OF ITS RESULTS. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS - THANKS TO THE SELECTED REGRESSION DRIVERS, FARMERS WHO OFFER TOURISM SERVICES COULD RECOGNIZE A PRIORI THEIR ENTREPRENEURIAL OPPORTUNITIES AND UNDERSTAND THE VARIABLES ON WHICH TO FOCUS TO INCREASE THEIR INCOME, WHICH COULD BE IN TURN STRENGTHENED BY POLICIES SEEKING TO DEVELOP THE ENDOGENOUS POTENTIAL. SOCIAL IMPLICATIONS - AGRI-TOURISM CAN FULFILL VARIOUS FUNCTIONS IN THE REGIONAL ECONOMY, WITH POSITIVE IMPLICATIONS FOR THE QUALITY OF LIFE OF RURAL SOCIETIES. ORIGINALITY/VALUE - ON THE EUROPEAN LEVEL, THERE IS CURRENTLY A LACK OF RESEARCH STUDYING THE VARIABLES AFFECTING AGRI-TOURISM REVENUE AND ENTREPRENEURIAL CHOICE THAT MOSTLY DEFINE PROFITABILITY. THIS MAY BE THE FIRST TIME THAT FADN DATA SET HAS BEEN UTILIZED FOR RESEARCHING FARM TOURISM BUSINESSES IN EUROPE.

UNTANGLING THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PARTISANSHIP, GENDER STEREOTYPES, AND SUPPORT FOR FEMALE CANDIDATES	JOURNAL OF WOMEN POLITICS & POLICY	EXISTING LITERATURE DEBATES WHETHER GENDER STEREOTYPES OR PARTISANSHIP HAS A GREATER EFFECT ON EVALUATIONS OF FEMALE CANDIDATES. FEMININE STEREOTYPES ARE CONSIDERED INCONGRUENT WITH LEADERSHIP ROLES, BUT PARTISANSHIP IS ALSO AN IMPORTANT CUE FOR MANY VOTERS. COMPLICATING THE INFLUENCE OF FEMININE STEREOTYPES IS THAT THIS CONCEPT OVERLAPS WITH STEREOTYPES ABOUT THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY. THIS MANUSCRIPT EXAMINES THE INFLUENCE OF PARTISANSHIP AND FEMININE STEREOTYPES IN HOW VOTERS PERCEIVE FEMALE CANDIDATES. USING AN ORIGINAL SURVEY EXPERIMENT, THE RESULTS UNCOVER SEVERAL FINDINGS. FIRST, PARTISANSHIP AND GENDER DO NOT COMBINE TO ACTIVATE FEMININE STEREOTYPES. SECOND, FEMININE INFORMATION ACTIVATES FEMININE STEREOTYPES FOR ONLY DEMOCRATIC FEMALE CANDIDATES WHILE MASCULINE INFORMATION PREVENTS FEMININE STEREOTYPING FOR ALL CANDIDATE TYPES. OVERALL, VOTERS EVALUATE DEMOCRATIC FEMALE CANDIDATES FAVORABLY WHEN THEY HAVE FEMININE OR MASCULINE INFORMATION, BUT REPUBLICAN FEMALE CANDIDATES RECEIVE EVALUATIONS THAT ARE MORE CRITICAL. THESE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT FEMININE STEREOTYPES AND PARTISANSHIP JOINTLY AFFECT PERCEPTIONS OF FEMALE CANDIDATES.

THIS QUALITATIVE STUDY GATHERED DATA FROM LGBTQ ADOLESCENTS REGARDING THEIR COMMUNITIES AND DESCRIBES THE RESOURCES THEY DRAW ON FOR SUPPORT. WE CONDUCTED 66 GO-ALONG INTERVIEWS WITH DIVERSE LGBTQ ADOLESCENTS (MEAN AGE = 16.6) IN MINNESOTA, MASSACHUSETTS, AND BRITISH COLUMBIA IN 2014-2015, IN WHICH INTERVIEWERS ACCOMPANIED PARTICIPANTS IN THEIR COMMUNITIES TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THOSE CONTEXTS. THEIR RESPONSES WERE SYSTEMATICALLY ORGANIZED AND CODED FOR COMMON THEMES, REFLECTING LEVELS OF THE SOCIAL ECOLOGICAL MODEL. PARTICIPANTS DESCRIBED RESOURCES AT EACH LEVEL, EMPHASIZING ORGANIZATIONAL, COMMUNITY, AND SOCIAL FACTORS SUCH AS LGBTQ YOUTH ORGANIZATIONS AND EVENTS, MEDIA PRESENCE, AND VISIBILITY OF LGBTQ ADULTS. NUMEROUS RESOURCES WERE IDENTIFIED, AND REPRESENTATIVE THEMES WERE HIGHLY CONSISTENT ACROSS LOCATIONS, GENDERS, ORIENTATIONS, RACIAL/ETHNIC GROUPS, AND CITY SIZE. FINDINGS SUGGEST NEW AVENUES FOR RESEARCH WITH LGBTQ YOUTH AND MANY OPPORTUNITIES FOR COMMUNITIES TO CREATE AND EXPAND RESOURCES AND SUPPORTS FOR THIS POPULATION.

SELF-DETERMINATION THEORY POSITS THAT INDIVIDUALS SEEK OUT ENVIRONMENTS THAT PROMOTE BASIC PSYCHOLOGICAL NEEDS; AMONG THESE NEEDS IS THE NEED FOR RELATEDNESS. WE EXAMINED THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SOCIAL LEISURE ENGAGEMENT (CONCEPTUALISED AS AN ENVIRONMENT THAT PROMOTES CONNECTIONS TO OTHERS) AND EMERGING ADULTS' DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMOLOGY. MORE SPECIFICALLY, WE HYPOTHESISED THAT THIS NEED-SUPPORTIVE ENVIRONMENT WOULD BE RELATED TO HIGHER LEVELS OF PEER SUPPORT (A FORM OF RELATEDNESS) AND WOULD PROMOTE BETTER MENTAL HEALTH. PARTICIPANTS (N=270) WERE BETWEEN THE AGES OF 18 AND 25. USING PATH MODELS, WE FOUND THAT THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT NEGATIVE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SOCIAL LEISURE ENGAGEMENT AND DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMOLOGY. FURTHERMORE, PEER SUPPORT SERVED AS A SIGNIFICANT LINKING MECHANISM BETWEEN SOCIAL LEISURE AND DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMOLOGY.

IN BOTH NOVELS, FEMALE FRIENDSHIPS ARE SHAPED BY PATRIARCHAL VIOLENCE AND DEVELOP IN THE CONTEXT OF THE RURAL, SEGREGATED, EARLY TWENTIETH-CENTURY U.S. SOUTH. BUT THE TWO NOVELS ALSO DIVERGE IN SIGNIFICANT WAYS, AS DIFFERENCES IN RACE, GENDER, CLASS, AND SEXUALITY SHAPE THEIR PROTAGONISTS' EXPERIENCES OF LOVE AND FRIENDSHIP. AS FILMMAKERS STEVEN SPIELBERG AND JON AVNET ADAPTED THESE NOVELS FOR THE SCREEN, THEY MADE DECISIONS ABOUT HOW TO PORTRAY THE TEXTS' REPRESENTATIONS OF HOMOEROTIC FRIENDSHIP AND SAME-SEX LOVE. BOTH FILMS GENERATED SIGNIFICANT CULTURAL CONTROVERSY AS A RESULT, PARTICULARLY AS SOME VIEWERS CLAIMED THAT THE FILMS ELIDED THE NOVELS' REPRESENTATIONS OF LESBIAN SEXUALITY. BUILDING UPON RECENT SCHOLARSHIP IN CRITICAL RACE THEORY, QUEER THEORY, AND FRIENDSHIP STUDIES, I ARGUE THAT WALKER'S AND FLAGG'S REPRESENTATIONS OF QUEER FRIENDSHIP, A TERM THAT I DESCRIBE IN MORE DETAIL THROUGHOUT THE ESSAY, SUBVERT DOMINANT CLASSIFICATIONS OF ROMANTIC, FAMILIAL, AND PLATONIC LOVE. BY COMPARATIVELY ANALYZING THE AMERICAN PUBLIC'S RECEPTION OF THE TWO FILM ADAPTATIONS IN CONJUNCTION WITH CLOSE READINGS OF SCENES FROM THE NOVELS AND FILMS, I REVEAL HOW REPRESENTATIONS OF QUEER FRIENDSHIP NOT ONLY CATALYZE CULTURAL CONTROVERSY, BUT ALSO SERVE AS A VEHICLE OF SOCIAL CRITICISM.

ALTHOUGH LOWERING OF VOICE FUNDAMENTAL FREQUENCY (F(0)) OCCURS WITH TESTOSTERONE THERAPY, EVIDENCE SUGGESTS VOICE AND GENDER IDENTITY MAY NOT FULLY ALIGN-I.E., VOICE-GENDER CONGRUENCE MAY NOT BE ACHIEVED-WITH ITS USE. AIM: THIS META-ANALYTIC REVIEW EVALUATES THE EFFECTIVENESS OF TESTOSTERONE THERAPY TO MASCULINIZE VOICE IN TRANSGENDER PATIENTS. METHODS: MULTIPLE ELECTRONIC DATABASES WERE QUERIED (INCLUSION DATES: FROM DATABASE INCEPTION UP TO OCTOBER 27, 2017) TO IDENTIFY ORIGINAL RESEARCH ON VOICE MASCULINIZATION USING TESTOSTERONE THERAPY. NINETEEN ARTICLES WERE INCLUDED IN THIS META-ANALYTIC REVIEW, WHICH FOLLOWED PRISMA GUIDELINES. IN ADDITION TO QUALITATIVE ANALYSES, RANDOM EFFECTS PROPORTION META-ANALYSES WERE PERFORMED ON DATA RELATED TO F(0), VOICE-GENDER CONGRUENCE, VOICE PROBLEMS, AND SATISFACTION WITH VOICE. RESULTS: A META-ANALYSIS ON F(0) DATA SHOWED AFTER 1 YEAR OF TESTOSTERONE THERAPY A COMBINED ESTIMATE OF 21% OF PARTICIPANTS (95% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL [CI]: 5%-43%; I-2: 59.9%) DID NOT ACHIEVE CISGENDER MALE NORMATIVE FREQUENCIES (F(0) <= 131 HZ). META-ANALYSES ON INCOMPLETE VOICE-GENDER CONGRUENCE AND VOICE PROBLEMS INDICATED COMBINED ESTIMATES OF 21% (95% CI: 10%-34%; I-2: 0.0%) AND 46% (95% CI: 14%-79%; I2: 90.2%), RESPECTIVELY. REGARDING INCOMPLETE SATISFACTION WITH VOICE, A META-ANALYSIS SHOWED A COMBINED ESTIMATE OF 16% (95% CI: 7%-28%; I-2: 0.0%). DISCUSSION: WE FOUND THAT NOT ALL TRANSGENDER PATIENTS USING TESTOSTERONE THERAPY TO MASCULINIZE VOICE SHOULD EXPECT F(0) LOWERING TO CISGENDER MALE NORMATIVE FREQUENCIES AFTER 1 YEAR. THE VOCAL TRANSITION MAY INVOLVE VOICE PROBLEMS FOR MANY PATIENTS, AND SOME MIGHT NOT ACHIEVE VOICE-GENDER CONGRUENCE WITHOUT ADDITIONAL, VOICE-SPECIFIC INTERVENTION. GIVEN THESE FINDINGS, A VOICE EVALUATION SHOULD OCCUR PRIOR TO INITIATING TESTOSTERONE THERAPY AND INVOLVE COUNSELING ON EXPECTATIONS FOR VOICE.

COMPARING IMPLICIT AND EXPLICIT ATTITUDES OF GAY, STRAIGHT, AND NON-MONOSEXUAL GROUPS TOWARD TRANSMEN AND TRANSWOMEN	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TRANSGENDERISM	BACKGROUND: TRANSPHOBIA STUDIES HAVE TYPICALLY RELIED ON SELF-REPORT MEASURES FROM HETEROSEXUAL SAMPLES. HOWEVER, THERE IS EVIDENCE SUGGESTING THE NEED TO USE INDIRECT MEASURES AND TO EXPLORE TRANSPHOBIA AMONG OTHER POPULATIONS. AIMS: THIS STUDY EXAMINED HOW EXPLICIT AND IMPLICIT ATTITUDES TOWARD TRANSWOMEN AND TRANSMEN DIFFER BETWEEN PEOPLE OF DIFFERENT SEXUAL ORIENTATIONS. METHODS: CISGENDER PARTICIPANTS (N = 265) COMPLETED MEASURES OF EXPLICIT FEELINGS TOWARD TRANSMEN AND TRANSWOMEN, AS WELL AS IMPLICIT ASSOCIATION TESTS (IAT) FOR EACH GROUP. COMPARISONS WERE MADE BETWEEN 54 GAY, 79 STRAIGHT, AND 132 NON-MONOSEXUAL (ASEXUAL, BISEXUAL, PANSEXUAL) INDIVIDUALS. RESULTS: AN INTERACTION WAS FOUND BETWEEN MEASUREMENT TYPE (EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT) AND SEXUAL ORIENTATION (STRAIGHT, GAY, NON-MONOSEXUAL). WITH REGARD TO TRANSMEN, GAY RESPONDENTS' EXPLICIT AND IMPLICIT SCORES DIVERGED SUCH THAT THEY EXPLICITLY REPORTED LOWER BIAS THAN THEIR STRAIGHT COUNTERPARTS, BUT THEIR TRANSMEN-IAT SHOWED AN IMPLICIT PREFERENCE FOR BIOLOGICAL MEN OVER TRANSMEN. FOR ATTITUDES TOWARD TRANSWOMEN, IMPLICIT MEASUREMENT SCORES WERE CONSISTENTLY NEGATIVE AND DID NOT DIFFER BY GROUP. GAY PARTICIPANTS ALSO REPORTED POSITIVE EXPLICIT ATTITUDES TOWARD TRANSWOMEN, SIMILAR TO NON-MONOSEXUAL PEOPLE. DISCUSSION: OVERALL, FINDINGS SHOW THAT GAY PEOPLE TEND TO REPORT POSITIVE ATTITUDES TOWARD TRANSGENDER PEOPLE EXPLICITLY, BUT TEND TO HAVE IMPLICIT BIAS AGAINST BOTH TRANSMEN AND TRANSWOMEN. FUTURE STUDIES NEED TO EXPLORE THE ORIGINS OF THESE BIASES AND HOW THEY RELATE TO THE COMPLEX INTERPLAY OF SEX, GENDER, AND SEXUAL ORIENTATION.

PREVIOUS RESEARCH PREDICTED THAT STIGMA WOULD DECLINE OVER TIME WITH INCREASED CONTACT WITH PLWH, UNDERSTANDING OF THE DISEASE AND AVAILABILITY OF TREATMENT. THE AIM OF THE RESEARCH WAS TO EXPLORE CHANGE IN STIGMA OVER A 12-YEAR PERIOD, BY COMPARING DATA COLLECTED FROM TWO LARGE CROSS-SECTIONAL SAMPLES FROM SOUTH AFRICAN COMMUNITIES IN 2004 (BEFORE THE ROLL-OUT OF ANTIRETROVIRAL TREATMENT (ART)) AND IN 2016. STUDENTS RECRUITED RESPONDENTS ACCORDING TO CRITERIA RELATED TO AGE, GENDER, RACE AND AREA OF LIVING. A SURVEY ASSESSING MORAL JUDGEMENT AND INTERPERSONAL DISTANCE WAS USED TO ASSESS PERSONAL AND PERCEIVED COMMUNITY STIGMA. RESPONSES TO TEN IDENTICAL ITEMS USED IN THE 2004 AND 2016 DATA COLLECTION WERE COMPARED. PERSONAL STIGMA ATTACHED TO HIV DECREASED SIGNIFICANTLY OVER TIME, EXCEPT IN RESPECT OF HAVING CLOSE CONTACT WITH PLWH, SUCH AS DATING AND BEFRIENDING. PERCEIVED COMMUNITY STIGMA REMAINED HIGH IN ALL SUBGROUPS. IT IS ARGUED THAT PERCEIVED COMMUNITY STIGMA CONTRIBUTES TO HIGH LEVELS OF INTERNALISED STIGMA AMONG PLWH. INTERVENTIONS SHOULD FOCUS ON HELPING PLWH TO COPE WITH PERCEIVED STIGMA AND STRATEGIES TO ADDRESS STEREOTYPING, WHICH CONTRIBUTES TO PERCEIVED COMMUNITY STIGMA.

USING NATIONAL BASELINE DATA FROM THE CHINA HEALTH AND RETIREMENT LONGITUDINAL STUDY (CHARLS), A SURVEY CONDUCTED FROM 2011 TO 2012, THIS ARTICLE APPLIES LOGISTIC MODELS TO INVESTIGATE THE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN FEMALE FERTILITY HISTORY (PARITY, EARLY CHILDBEARING, LATE CHILDBEARING) AND MIDDLE-AGED AND LATE-LIFE HEALTH. WE FIND THAT PARITY IS RELATED TO THE MID-LATE-LIFE HEALTH OF WOMEN. WOMEN WITH FOUR CHILDREN OR MORE ARE MORE LIKELY TO SUFFER FROM ACTIVITIES OF DAILY LIVING (ADL) IMPAIRMENT AND POORER SELF-RATED HEALTH THAN THOSE WITH ONE TO THREE CHILDREN. EARLY CHILDBEARING IS ASSOCIATED WITH ADL IMPAIRMENT; HOWEVER, THE CORRELATION IS MEDIATED BY SOCIOECONOMIC STATUS. EARLY CHILDBEARING IS RELATED TO SELF-RATED HEALTH IN LATER LIFE BY AN INDIRECT-ONLY MEDIATION EFFECT VIA EDUCATIONAL ATTAINMENT AND PERSONAL INCOME.

SERIOUS PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTRESS, SEX, AND FALLS AMONG THE ELDERLY	JOURNAL OF WOMEN & AGING	SERIOUS PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTRESS AND FALLS ARE TWO MAJOR PUBLIC HEALTH PROBLEMS AMONG THE ELDERLY. THIS STUDY AIMS TO TEST THE HYPOTHESIS THAT ALTHOUGH SERIOUS PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTRESS CAN INCREASE THE RISKS OF FALLS AMONG THE ELDERLY, IT TENDS TO AFFECT ELDERLY WOMEN MORE THAN ELDERLY MEN. DATA OF THIS STUDY ARE FROM THE 2011 CALIFORNIA HEALTH SURVEY INTERVIEWS (CHIS). WE EXTRACTED A SAMPLE OF 13,153 RESPONDENTS AGED 65 AND OLDER FOR THIS STUDY, INCLUDING 8,087 FEMALES AND 5,066 MALES. WE TESTED BOTH UNADJUSTED AND ADJUSTED INTERACTION EFFECTS USING BIVARIATE AND MULTIVARIATE LOGISTIC REGRESSION ANALYSIS. ELDERLY WOMEN WITH SERIOUS PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTRESS HAD THE GREATEST LIKELIHOOD OF FALLS AS COMPARED TO MEN WITH SERIOUS PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTRESS AND MEN AND WOMEN WITHOUT SERIOUS PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTRESS. WITH RESPECT TO THE COVARIATES, LIMITATIONS OF PHYSICAL ACTIVITY AND POOR SELF-RATED HEALTH STATUS, ASIAN RACE, AND OLDER AGE WERE MORE LIKELY TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH FALLS. THIS STUDY PROVIDES FURTHER INFORMATION ON SEX DISPARITIES OF FALLS AMONG THE ELDERLY SUCH THAT SERIOUS PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTRESS HAS A GREATER IMPACT ON FALLS FOR ELDERLY WOMEN THAN ELDERLY MEN. THUS, THE FINDINGS OF OUR STUDIES SUGGEST THAT MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES AND INTERVENTION CAN BE USEFUL TO PREVENT FALLS FOR ELDERLY WOMEN.

INVISIBILITY AS A CONCEPT, HOWEVER, DOES NOT ALLOW FOR A DEEPER THEORETICAL ENGAGEMENT WITH THE REASONS AND CONSEQUENCES OF THE LACK OF REPRESENTATION OF QUEERNESS IN HEALTHCARE. DRAWING ON EMPIRICAL RESEARCH WITH QUEER HEALTHCARE USERS IN SOUTH AFRICA, I ARGUE THAT 'INVISIBILITY' ACTUALLY ENCOMPASSES TWO DISTINCT, THOUGH RELATED, CONCEPTS: QUEER SYMBOLIC ANNIHILATION AS THE REASON FOR THE EXCLUSION OF QUEER IDENTITIES IN HEALTH PROFESSIONS EDUCATION AND, BY CONSEQUENCE, IN HEALTHCARE; AND QUEER (UN) INTELLIGIBILITY AS THE CONSEQUENCE OF THIS SYSTEMIC ERASURE. BY SIMPLY ATTRIBUTING DISCRIMINATORY HEALTHCARE EXPERIENCES OF QUEER PEOPLE TO 'INVISIBILITY' WE ARE MISSING OPPORTUNITIES TO ADDRESS UNDERLYING ISSUES OF QUEER SYMBOLIC ANNIHILATION AND UNINTELLIGIBILITY.

THE 'CLOSET' HERE IS A METAPHOR THAT DESCRIBES THE CONCEALMENT OF ONE'S HOMOSEXUAL IDENTITY AND THE OUTWARD 'PERFORMANCE' OF HETEROSEXUALITY. BRITISH PAKISTANI LESBIANS PRECARIOUSLY INHABIT A SOCIOCULTURAL ENVIRONMENT THAT CONSTRAINS THE EXPRESSION OF FEMALE SEXUALITY. WOMEN WHO OPPOSE AND CONTRAVENE HETERONORMATIVE VALUES AND IDEALS UNSETTLE COMFORTABLE ASSUMPTIONS OF HETEROSEXUALITY. BEING IN THE CLOSET KEEPS LESBIANS ISOLATED AND MARGINALISED FROM THEIR ETHNIC AND CULTURAL COMMUNITIES. DRAWING ON FINDINGS FROM ONLINE INTERVIEWS WITH SEVEN BRITISH PAKISTANI LESBIANS, THE STUDY EXPLORES WHAT SHAPES THEIR DECISION TO STAY WITHIN THE CLOSET AND HOW DOING SO INFLUENCES THEIR SELF-PERCEPTION. BEING IN THE CLOSET IS A SOURCE OF CONSIDERABLE CONFLICT, STRAIN AND ANXIETY, WHICH HAS AN IMPACT ON THE WOMEN'S READINESS TO EMBRACE INDIVIDUAL CHOICE, FREEDOM AND DESIRE. FINDINGS ORIENTATE THE READER TOWARD AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE MULTIPLE, INTERLOCKING SYSTEMS OF SOCIAL RELATIONS WITHIN WHICH BRITISH PAKISTANI LESBIANS ARE MARGINALISED AS THE RESULT OF THEIR GENDER, SEXUALITY AND ETHNIC IDENTITY.		2018	FAMILY STUDIES; SOCIAL SCIENCES, BIOMEDICAL

THIS QUALITATIVE STUDY EXPLORES THE WAYS IN WHICH EXPOSURE TO INCARCERATION IMPACTS THE DYNAMICS OF SEXUAL PARTNERING AMONG RECENTLY RELEASED BLACK MEN IN BALTIMORE, USA. IN-DEPTH INTERVIEWS WERE CONDUCTED WITH 19 RECENTLY RELEASED BLACK MEN BETWEEN 21-45 YEARS OF AGE LIVING IN THE CITY. DATA WERE ANALYSED USING A COMBINATION OF INDUCTIVE AND DEDUCTIVE APPROACHES. PARTICIPANTS REPORTED THAT WOMEN LIVING IN THE NEIGHBOURHOODS TO WHICH THEY RETURNED FOUND RECENTLY RELEASED MEN TO BE HIGHLY DESIRABLE SEXUAL PARTNERS BECAUSE THEY OFFERED INCREASED POTENTIAL FOR SEXUAL GRATIFICATION, WERE PERCEIVED AS HEALTHIER THAN OTHER SEXUAL PARTNERS IN THEIR COMMUNITIES AND REPRESENTED OPPORTUNITIES FOR ATTAINING FINANCIAL STABILITY AND THE POTENTIAL FOR ESTABLISHING ROMANTIC PARTNERSHIPS. AS A RESULT, MEN REPORTED THEY HAD MORE OPPORTUNITIES FOR SEX AND MORE POWER TO NEGOTIATE SEX WITH WOMEN. RECENTLY RELEASED BLACK MEN'S PERCEPTIONS OF THEIR OWN SEXUAL DESIRABILITY AMONG WOMEN RAISE IMPORTANT IMPLICATIONS REGARDING POWER IN THE SEXUAL RELATIONSHIPS OF RECENTLY RELEASED MEN THAT MAY INCREASE HIV- AND SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED INFECTION-RELATED RISK FOR RECENTLY RELEASED MEN AND THEIR SEXUAL PARTNERS.

THE 2009 VIOLENCE AGAINST CHILDREN SURVEY IN ZANZIBAR INDICATED THAT 6% OF GIRLS AND 9% OF BOYS REPORTED HAVING EXPERIENCED SEXUAL VIOLENCE BEFORE THE AGE OF 18 YEARS. THIS PAPER REPORTS ON AN IN-DEPTH QUALITATIVE STUDY CONDUCTED IN ZANZIBAR TO PROVIDE FURTHER INSIGHTS TO THESE FINDINGS BY EXAMINING THE CIRCUMSTANCES FOR SEXUAL AND OTHER VIOLENCE AGAINST CHILDREN IN ZANZIBAR. TWENTY-FOUR IN-DEPTH INTERVIEWS WITH YOUNG PEOPLE AND 18 FOCUS-GROUP DISCUSSIONS WITH YOUNG PEOPLE AND ADULTS WERE CONDUCTED IN RURAL AND URBAN ZANZIBAR. A FURTHER 8 INTERVIEWS WERE CONDUCTED WITH PARENTS AND KEY STAKEHOLDERS IN GOVERNMENT AND NGO OFFICES THAT PROVIDE SERVICES FOR CHILDREN. THE FINDINGS REVEALED THAT RELIGIOUS AND CULTURAL PRACTICES, WHICH FORM THE FOUNDATION OF SWAHILI CULTURE IN ZANZIBAR, PROVIDE A MORAL FRAME FOR CHILDHOOD DEVELOPMENT, BUT STRUCTURAL FACTORS MAKE CHILDREN VULNERABLE TO SEXUAL VIOLENCE. BOTH BOYS AND GIRLS ARE VULNERABLE TO SEXUAL VIOLENCE IN THE HOME, NEIGHBOURHOOD, AT SCHOOL AND, IN PARTICULAR, AT MADRASA OR QUR'ANIC SCHOOLS. AS RELIGION AND CULTURE ARE STRONG INFLUENCES ON CHILDHOOD, PREVENTING SEXUAL VIOLENCE AT MADRASA SCHOOLS WOULD STRENGTHEN THE POSITIVE ASPECTS OF RELIGIOUS TEACHINGS FOR ENSURING A SAFE CHILDHOOD.

USING A NATIONALLY REPRESENTATIVE SAMPLE OF 47,545 MARRIED WOMEN IN THEIR CHILDBEARING YEARS, MULTINOMIAL LOGISTIC REGRESSION MODELS EXAMINE WOMEN'S AGENCY, SPECIFICALLY HOUSEHOLD DECISION-MAKING AND ATTITUDES TOWARDS INTIMATE PARTNER VIOLENCE AND CONTRACEPTIVE METHOD TYPE. IN 2014, LARC USE SIGNIFICANTLY DECLINED AND SHORT-ACTING METHOD USE WAS HIGHER THAN IN 2008. WOMEN WHO MADE HOUSEHOLD DECISIONS AND WERE LESS ACCEPTING OF INTIMATE PARTNER VIOLENCE WERE MORE LIKELY TO USE LARC (VS. NO METHOD). WOMEN WHO MADE MORE JOINT DECISIONS WITH SPOUSES WERE MORE LIKELY TO USE LARC (VS. NO METHOD) COMPARED TO THOSE MAKING INDIVIDUAL DECISIONS. FINDINGS HAVE IMPLICATIONS FOR FAMILY PLANNING PROGRAMMES, AND EFFORTS INVOLVING MEN TO INCREASE HOUSEHOLD GENDER EQUALITY AND LOWER THE ACCEPTANCE OF INTIMATE PARTNER VIOLENCE MAY PROMOTE LARC USE IN EGYPT.

RESUMENUN FENOMENO EXTENDIDO EN TANZANIA ES LA VIOLENCIA CONTRA LA MUJER INFLIGIDA POR SU PAREJA INTIMA MASCULINA (VPI). AUNQUE LAS INVESTIGACIONES SOBRE EL TEMA EN EL AFRICA SUBSAHARIANA SON ESCASAS, LA EVIDENCIA TEORICA Y EMPIRICA SUGIERE QUE LAS REDES ESTABLECIDAS ENTRE PARES PUEDEN DESEMPENAR UN ROL IMPORTANTE PARA MOLDEAR LA FORMA EN QUE SE PERPETRA LA VPI. PARTIENDO DE LAS TEORIAS DEL APRENDIZAJE SOCIAL, LA INFLUENCIA SOCIAL, Y LA DE GENERO Y PODER, EL OBJETIVO DEL PRESENTE ESTUDIO SE ORIENTO A EXAMINAR SI LA EXISTENCIA DE REDES ENTRE PARES INCIDE EN LA PERPETRACION DE LA VPI POR PARTE DE LOS HOMBRES EN DAR ES SALAM, TANZANIA, Y DE QUE MANERA INCIDEN EN ELLA. LAS AUTORAS REALIZARON ENTREVISTAS EN PROFUNDIDAD (N=40) EN UNA SUBMUESTRA DE 20 HOMBRES ADSCRITOS A UN ENSAYO CONTROLADO ALEATORIO POR GRUPOS EN CONDICION DE CONTROLES. SE SELECCIONO INTENCIONALMENTE COMO PARTICIPANTES A QUIENES PREVIAMENTE HABIAN INFORMADO QUE PERPETRARON VIOLENCIA FISICA CONTRA SU PAREJA INTIMA. PARA ANALIZAR LOS DATOS SE GENERARON RESUMENES NARRATIVOS Y CODIFICACIONES TEMATICAS E INTERPRETATIVAS. NO SE DETECTARON CASOS EN LOS CUALES LOS HOMBRES ENTREVISTADOS HAYAN OPTADO POR INCLUIRSE EN REDES DE PARES QUE MANIFESTABAN CIERTOS VALORES O CONDUCTAS; EN CAMBIO, SENALARON VARIOS MECANISMOS UTILIZADOS POR SUS PARES PARA INCIDIR EN LA PERPETRACION DE LA VIOLENCIA: (1) LA INTERNALIZACION DE LAS NORMAS ESTABLECIDAS EN DICHAS REDES; (2) LA PRESION PARA ADAPTARSE A LAS NORMAS DE ESTAS; Y (3) EL INVOLUCRAMIENTO DIRECTO DE LOS PARES PARA MOLDEAR LAS DINAMICAS DE PODER AL INTERIOR DE LAS PAREJAS. ESTOS HALLAZGOS INSINUAN QUE LAS REDES ENTRE PARES INCIDEN EN LA PERPETRACION MASCULINA DE LA VPI; POR ELLO, LOS PROGRAMAS DE INTERVENCION QUE SE IMPLEMENTEN EN EL FUTURO DEBEN SER DIRIGIDOS HACIA LA ATENCION DE DICHAS REDES.

USING SEVEN DIFFERENT SURVEYS, THE ELEVEN CONTRIBUTIONS IN THIS VOLUME STUDY THE DISTRIBUTIVE CONSEQUENCES OF POST-REFORM CARE POLICIES AND THE IMPACT OF UNPAID CARE RESPONSIBILITIES ON WOMEN'S AND MEN'S OPPORTUNITIES AND GENDER INEQUALITY. OVERALL, REDUCED CARE SERVICES HAVE CREATED CARE DEFICITS FOR DISADVANTAGED GROUPS, INCLUDING LOW-INCOME RURAL ELDERLY AND CHILDREN. THE SHIFTED CARE BURDEN HAS ALSO LIMITED WOMEN'S ABILITY TO PARTICIPATE FULLY IN THE MARKET ECONOMY AND HAS CONTRIBUTED TO RISING GENDER INEQUALITIES IN LABOR FORCE PARTICIPATION, OFF-FARM EMPLOYMENT, EARNINGS, PENSIONS, AND MENTAL HEALTH OUTCOMES.

THE ANALYSIS APPLIES A POLICY-BASED IDENTIFICATION STRATEGY TO CONTROL FOR THE ENDOGENOUS RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PAID LEAVE ENTITLEMENTS AND BREASTFEEDING DECISIONS. ESTIMATES SHOW THAT PAID MATERNITY LEAVE HAS A STRONG POSITIVE EFFECT ON BREASTFEEDING DURATION. SPECIFICALLY, IF THE LENGTH OF PAID LEAVE INCREASES BY THIRTY DAYS, THEN THE PROBABILITY OF BREASTFEEDING FOR AT LEAST SIX MONTHS INCREASES BY 12 PERCENTAGE POINTS. BETWEEN 1988 AND 2008, THE AVERAGE LENGTH OF PAID LEAVE FOR MOTHERS WITHOUT A COLLEGE EDUCATION DECREASED BY TWENTY-THREE DAYS, WHICH REDUCED THESE MOTHERS' PROBABILITY OF BREASTFEEDING FOR AT LEAST SIX MONTHS BY 9 PERCENTAGE POINTS. THESE RESULTS SUPPORT THE VIEW THAT PAID MATERNITY LEAVE ENHANCES THE ABILITY OF EMPLOYED WOMEN TO SUSTAIN BREASTFEEDING AND CALL FOR UNIVERSAL PAID LEAVE ENTITLEMENTS.

FURTHER ANALYSIS REVEALS A SHARP GENDER DIVISION IN PATTERNS OF FAMILY CARE IN CHINA. WHILE MEN ARE MORE LIKELY TO RECEIVE CARE FROM THEIR WIVES, WOMEN ARE PRIMARILY CARED FOR BY THEIR CHILDREN. MARITAL STATUS AND SPOUSE HEALTH ALSO AFFECT PROVISION OF CARE, WITH INFIRM WOMEN WHO HAVE HEALTHY HUSBANDS LESS LIKELY TO RECEIVE CARE THAN INFIRM MEN WITH HEALTHY WIVES.

IT FOCUSES ON THE ROLES THAT CHILDCARE AND HOUSEHOLD COMPOSITION PLAY IN THE EMPLOYMENT DECISIONS OF PRIME-AGE MARRIED INDIVIDUALS OF MUSLIM AND NON-MUSLIM ETHNICITY. USING THE 2012 CHINA HOUSEHOLD ETHNICITY SURVEY (CHES), THE STUDY FINDS THAT CHILDREN GENERALLY DECREASE WOMEN'S LIKELIHOOD OF EMPLOYMENT OUTSIDE THE HOME AND INCREASE MEN'S. THE GENDER GAP IN THE PROBABILITY OF OFF-FARM EMPLOYMENT IS LARGER FOR THOSE OF MUSLIM ETHNICITY. NON-MUSLIM PARENTS OF SONS ARE MORE LIKELY TO MIGRATE FOR EMPLOYMENT THAN PARENTS OF DAUGHTERS. THE PRESENCE OF WOMEN OF GRANDPARENT AGE (46-70) UNIVERSALLY FACILITATES LABOR MIGRATION. MEN OF GRANDPARENT AGE TEND TO INCREASE ONLY THE PROBABILITY THAT NON-MUSLIM PARENTS MIGRATE FOR EMPLOYMENT.

THIS STUDY SHOWS THAT DISADVANTAGES IN THE LABOR MARKET FOR WOMEN ARE THE PRIMARY DRIVERS OF THE GENDER PENSION GAP. AMONG PEOPLE AGE 60 AND OLDER, WOMEN RECEIVE ABOUT HALF OF THE AMOUNT OF MEN'S SOCIAL PENSIONS. USING THE 2013 WAVE OF CHINA HEALTH AND RETIREMENT LONGITUDINAL STUDY (CHARLS) AND THE CHARLS LIFE HISTORY SURVEY OF 2014, THIS CONTRIBUTION HAS THREE MAIN FINDINGS. FIRST, ABOUT THREE-QUARTERS OF THE DEFICIT IN WOMEN'S PENSIONS IS EXPLAINED BY WOMEN'S LOWER LIKELIHOOD OF RECEIVING OCCUPATIONAL PENSIONS, AND ONE-THIRD IS DUE TO SMALLER BENEFITS WHEN THEY DO RECEIVE THEM. SECOND, THE GENDER DEFICIT IN RECEIVING AN OCCUPATIONAL PENSION CAN BE EXPLAINED BY EDUCATION LEVEL AND EMPLOYMENT SECTOR. THIRD, AMONG PENSION RECIPIENTS, NEARLY ONE-THIRD OF THE GENDER BENEFIT GAP IS EXPLAINED BY WOMEN'S FEWER YEARS OF EMPLOYMENT AND LOWER SALARIES.

USING THE 2011 AND 2013 WAVES OF THE CHINA HEALTH AND RETIREMENT LONGITUDINAL STUDY (CHARLS), THE STUDY FINDS THAT THE NEW RURAL PENSION PROGRAM (NRPP) REDUCED THE HOURS OF FARMWORK AND INCREASED THE HOURS OF GRANDCHILD CARE AMONG ELDERLY RURAL MEN; AND BOTH ELDERLY WOMEN AND MEN REPORTED LESS EXPECTED RELIANCE ON ADULT CHILDREN FOR FINANCIAL SUPPORT WHEN THEY BECOME INFIRM. THESE DIFFERENTIAL EFFECTS PROBABLY OCCUR BECAUSE THE SIZE OF THE PENSION BENEFIT IS VERY SMALL AND BECAUSE OF PREVIOUS GENDER DIFFERENCES IN FARMWORK AND GRANDCHILD CARE. ADDITIONALLY, THE STUDY SHOWS THAT ADULT CHILDREN REDUCED OUT-MIGRATION AND INCREASED THEIR HOURS SPENT IN FARMING ACTIVITIES, INDICATING THAT THE EFFECT OF THE NRPP HAS SPILLED OVER TO YOUNGER MEMBERS OF THE HOUSEHOLD.

DATA ARE BASED ON LIFE-HISTORY INTERVIEWS WITH 16 TAIWANESE IMMIGRANT WOMEN AND ETHNOGRAPHIC OBSERVATIONS IN A MIDWEST URBAN AREA. FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT MIDDLE-CLASS IMMIGRANTS' ABILITIES TO HOST IN-LAWS FOR LENGTHY PERIODS AND PARENTS-IN-LAW'S FINANCIAL SUPPORT FOR IMMIGRANT COUPLES LEAD TO THE LIVING ARRANGEMENT OF THREE-GENERATION HOUSEHOLDS IN MANY IMMIGRANT FAMILIES.

BASED ON EMPIRICAL DATA COLLECTED ON ROMANCE TOURS WITHIN ALL GEOGRAPHIC SPACES WITH MALE PARTICIPANTS, I SUGGEST THAT MEN'S RACIALIZED ASSUMPTIONS REGARDING WOMEN'S INTENTIONS WITHIN THE INDUSTRY, AS WELL AS WHAT TYPE OF AGENCY THEY POSSESS, ARE HEAVILY BASED ON TROPES OF THE THIRD WORLD AS BACKWARDS, TRADITIONAL, AND STATIC.

ISI000428783600008	LEAP, BRADEN	NOT A ZERO-SUM GAME: INEQUALITIES AND RESILIENCE IN SUMNER, MISSOURI, THE GOOSELESS GOOSE CAPITAL OF THE WORLD	GENDER PLACE AND CULTURE	RECENT WORKS ON SOCIO-ECOLOGICAL RESILIENCE STRESS THE NEED TO INTEGRATE INEQUALITIES AND POWER INTO CONSIDERATIONS OF HOW COMMUNITIES ARE REORGANIZED IN RESPONSE TO SOCIO-ECOLOGICAL TRANSFORMATIONS SUCH AS CLIMATE CHANGE. THESE WORKS HAVE OFTEN APPROACHED INEQUALITIES AND POWER AS ZERO-SUM GAMES, WITH SCHOLARS FRAMING INDIVIDUALS AND GROUPS WITHIN COMMUNITIES AS EITHER EMPOWERED OR MARGINALIZED. DRAWING FROM 20MONTHS OF FIELDWORK IN A RURAL COMMUNITY IN THE CENTRAL UNITED STATES THAT WAS BEING REARRANGED IN RESPONSE TO SHIFTS IN TRANS-NATIONAL GOOSE MIGRATION PATTERNS, THE AUTHOR SHOWS INEQUALITIES AND POWER DO NOT WORK IN SUCH DICHOTOMOUS MANNERS BECAUSE DIFFERENT DIMENSIONS OF INEQUALITY INTERSECT AND TRANSFORM EACH OTHER IN RECIPROCAL MANNERS. GENDER, CLASS, AND SEXUALITY INTERSECTED TO INFORM HOW INDIVIDUALS SUSTAINED THEIR COMMUNITY, AND PARTICULAR MEN AND WOMEN WERE SIMULTANEOUSLY (DIS)ADVANTAGED BECAUSE OF HOW THEIR RELATIONSHIPS WITH EACH OTHER WERE REARRANGED IN RESPONSE TO SHIFTING GOOSE MIGRATION PATTERNS. THESE FINDINGS SUGGEST SCHOLARS AND POLICY MAKERS WORKING ON ISSUES RELATED TO SOCIO-ECOLOGICAL RESILIENCE CAN BETTER ACCOUNT FOR INEQUALITIES AND POWER BY UTILIZING THE THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK OF INTERSECTIONALITY.

ISI000428749800002	KURNIATI, ANNA; CHEN, CHING-MIN; EFENDI, FERRY; BERLIANA, SARNI MANIAR	FACTORS INFLUENCING INDONESIAN WOMEN'S USE OF MATERNAL HEALTH CARE SERVICES	HEALTH CARE FOR WOMEN INTERNATIONAL	EMPLOYING THE 2012 INDONESIA DEMOGRAPHIC AND HEALTH SURVEY DATA, WE AIMED TO EXAMINE FACTORS INFLUENCING MARRIED WOMEN TO USE MATERNITY SERVICES. DATA OF MARRIED WOMEN WHO HAD GIVEN BIRTH IN THE LAST FIVE YEARS BEFORE THE SURVEY WERE INCLUDED IN THE ANALYSIS (N = 14,672). FACTORS OF EDUCATION, EMPLOYMENT, WOMEN'S AGE AT FIRST MARRIAGE, AGE AT FIRST BIRTH, SPOUSAL EDUCATION DIFFERENCE, CONTRACEPTIVE USE, PLACE OF RESIDENCE, AND WOMAN'S ATTITUDE TOWARD WIFE BEATING WERE ASSOCIATED WITH THE USE OF ANTENATAL CARE, INSTITUTIONAL DELIVERY, AND POSTNATAL CARE SERVICES. THE LIKELIHOOD OF WOMEN USING THOSE RECOMMENDED MATERNAL HEALTH CARE SERVICES INCREASED ALONG WITH THE INCREASED EDUCATIONAL ATTAINMENT AMONG WOMEN AND THEIR SPOUSES, AND THE OLDER AGE AT FIRST BIRTH. HIGHER SCHOOLING YEARS MAY CONTRIBUTE TO IMPROVING ADEQUATE MATERNAL HEALTH CARE. COMMUNITY AWARENESS ON MATERNAL HEALTH ISSUES SHOULD BE PROMOTED AND INCLUDE THE PREVENTION OF EARLY MARRIAGE, TEENAGE PREGNANCIES, AND DOMESTIC VIOLENCE.

MORE THAN HALF OF THE WOMEN (64%) GAINED EXCESS WEIGHT DURING PREGNANCY, WITH AN AVERAGE OF 10 LBS IN EXCESS OF INSTITUTE OF MEDICINE GUIDELINES. LOGISTIC REGRESSION INDICATED THAT WOMEN THAT STARTED PREGNANCY AT AN OBESE BODY MASS INDEX; WHO WERE AFRICAN AMERICAN OR HAVING AN UNPLANNED PREGNANCY WERE AT SIGNIFICANT RISK OF GAINING EXCESS WEIGHT IN PREGNANCY. INTERVENTION TO PREVENT EXCESS WEIGHT GAIN DURING PREGNANCY IS CRITICAL IN ADDRESSING OBESITY EPIDEMIC IN THE UNITED STATES AND WORLDWIDE.
